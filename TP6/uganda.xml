    <text>State Minister for planning, Amos Lugoloobi has been remanded to Luzira Prison until April 20 when he's expected to be produced in court again following his arrest over Karamoja iron sheets scandal.

Mr Lugoloobi was on Friday arrested in connection with the mismanagement of iron sheets meant for the Karachunas (youth warriors) in Karamoja.

ICYMI: Among buys 500 iron sheets to avoid shaming Parliament

He was reportedly heading to Entebbe International Airport when security operatives intercepted him on Friday before he was taken to Kira Division Police Station where he was detained trough the weekend until Monday when he was arraigned in court.

He was arraigned before the Anti-Corruption Court presided over by the acting principal senior Grade One Magistrate, Mr Ebert Asiimwe and charged with two counts of dealing with suspect property contrary to Sections 21A of the Anti-Corruption Act (as amended).

The state prosecution said that Mr Lugoloobi on July 14, 2022 and February 2023 at OPM Stores in Namanve in Mukono District and at different places in Matugga, Wakiso District and Ntenjeru North Constituency in Kayunga District, dealt with government property, to wit; 400 pre-painted iron sheets marked "Office of the Prime Minister" having reason to believe that the said iron sheets were acquired as a result of loss of public property,, an offence under section 10(1) o the Anti-Corruption Act.

In the second account, the prosecution said Mr Lugoloobi between February 1 2023 and March 16, 2023 at OPM Stores in Namanve and at different places in Matugga, wakiso District and in Ntenjeru Constituency, Kayunga District dealt with suspect property, to wit; 300 pre-painted iron sheets marked "Office of the Prime Minister", having reason to believe that the said iron sheets were acquired as a result of loss of public property, an offence under Section 10 (I) of the Anti-Corruption Act.

The minister pleaded not guilty to both counts.

The Ntenjeru North MP's attempt to file for bail suffered a blow when the magistrate said he needed more time to peruse through the documents his lawyers had submitted to court.

Mr Asiimwe said said he could not make his ruling on Monday because of the length of the submissions made by the lawyers and that some issues could not be taken for granted.

As a result, the minister was remanded to Luzira prison until Thursday, April 20, 2023 when he will be produced in court for bail proceedings.

Mr Lugoloobi, who is also the Ntenjeru North County MP, reportedly received 600 iron sheets meant for the vulnerable people in Karamoja Sub-region.

He was one of the ministers who last Friday sent back iron sheets to the Office of the Prime Minister in Namanve, following President Museveni‚Äôs orders to his ministers to return the iron sheets or pay in cash the equivalent.

In February, the minister admitted to have used some of the iron sheets to roof a shed for his goats on his farm in Misanga Village, Bbaale Sub-county in Kayunga District.

He, however, removed them after there was public outcry over the ministers who allegedly diverted the iron sheets.

Popularly referred to as taata bisode by his constituents in Kayunga, Mr Lugoloobi is the second minister to be arrested over the mismanagement of the building materials.

Karamoja Affairs Minister Mary Goretti Kitutu, who is at the centre of the scandal, was last Friday was released on cash bail of Shs10m after spending a week in Luzira prison.

    <title>US couple loses Shs500m in alleged spiritual cleansing scam in Uganda</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/us-couple-loses-shs500m-in-alleged-spiritual-cleansing-scam-in-uganda-4201916</url>

    <text>Police are investigating a Ugandan pastor after he allegedly fleeced an American couple of Shs500m in a spiritual cleansing scam.

Pastor Denis Ssenyonga of God Holy Ministry International in Mukono District allegedly told Mr Hans Brabdt, an evangelist, and his wife Ragnhild Hvistendahl that God had revealed to him that demons were hovering on them and they would soon run into trouble.

ICYMI: State House arrests city pastor over mass fraud

He then reportedly said God had revealed to him that a sacrifice of Shs500m would enable him to defeat the demons.

Bishop Brabdt allegedly agreed and withdrew Shs500m from a bank in Jinja City before handing it over to the pastor.

Kampala Metropolitan Police deputy spokesperson Luke Owoyesigyire said the suspect was arrested on offences of obtaining money and goods by false pretence.

He added that they are still looking for his alleged accomplices ‚Äì a female Ugandan and a male Macedonian, who are on the run.

According to Pastor Ssenyonga‚Äôs statement , when the Bishop and the wife were leaving the country, they sold him their property, including furniture and vehicles.

‚ÄúThe suspect was arrested and denied obtaining money by false pretence. He said he only bought property from Bishop Brabdt and he paid as they agreed. The suspect was released on bond as investigations continue,‚Äù Mr Owoyesigyire said yesterday.

How it started

According to Bishop Brabdt, they got to know Pastor Ssenyonga through one Barbara Kansiime, a Ugandan, and her partner Borche Lliovski, a Macedonian, while they were on a pastoral visit in Macedonia.

‚ÄúThey convinced us to visit Uganda to help the orphans. They also told us that there was a prophet in Uganda who does miracles and also can prophesy about people,‚Äù Bishop Brabdt said.

He said when they came to Uganda in November 2022, they were welcomed by Ms Kansiime and Mr Borche who introduced them to Pastor Ssenyonga as a prophet.

According to police, the pastor shocked the duo by revealing to them their past and their challenges.

‚ÄúIt was then that he told them that they were possessed by a blood curse and a death mark that would make their lives difficult and later cause death to them and the only way to survive was to cleanse themselves by paying a sacrifice of Shs500m,‚Äù Mr Owoyesigyire said.

Gripped with fear, the couple accepted. On March 1, 2023, Bishop Brabdt visited Stanbic Bank in Jinja City where he withdrew Shs500m and handed it over to Pastor Ssenyonga.

Days later, the pastor reportedly told the couple that he had received another prophecy that they were not safe in Uganda and they should flee as soon as possible.

‚ÄúOn March 10, the couple left the country,‚Äù he said. Two weeks later, the pastor contacted them revealing another prophecy, this time it was indicating that the couple‚Äôs brother-in-law was also in trouble. It was then that Bishop Brabdt detected that it could be a scam as the pastor pestered them for money.

‚ÄúI found out that he was lying,‚Äù Bishop Brabdt said. Pastor Ssenyonga then allegedly cut all contacts with the bishop.

The agitated bishop sought help from his attorneys in Uganda and a criminal case was opened at Mukono Police Station.

Pastor Ssenyonga was arrested and detained before he was released on police bond, but the detectives seized the property, including two vehicles that the couple had left in the hands of Pastor Ssenyonga.

According to police, Pastor Ssenyonga presented a sales agreement in which he claimed Bishop Brabdt sold him the motor vehicles at Shs134m and household property at Shs132m.

‚ÄúThe victim conceals about the sale, but he said he sold them cheaply to him,‚Äù Mr Owoyesigyire said.</text>

    <title>Sudan's Daglo, feared Darfuri general fighting for power</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/sudan-s-daglo-feared-darfuri-general-fighting-for-power-4202786</url>
    <author>[]</author>
    <date>2023-04-17 17:57:30+00:00</date>
    <text>Feared Sudanese paramilitary commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo went from a militia chief in war-torn Darfur to the country's second-in-command -- to now battling the regular army for control of the country.

Daglo, leader of the large and heavily-armed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), collaborated with his now arch-rival, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in a 2021 military coup that derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of hardline president Omar al-Bashir.

Often dressed in desert fatigues, the tall and slightly stooped Daglo -- widely known by his nickname Hemeti, short for Mohamed -- has crafted a distinct image for himself and his troops, positioning the RSF as autonomous from the military.

An experienced battlefield commander, he has in recent months also deployed a savvy use of social media with posts on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok to address the country's overwhelmingly young population, with two thirds of Sudanese aged under 30.

Darfur upstart to statesman

Born in around 1975, a camel and sheep trader with little formal education, he rose to prominence when Khartoum's hardline government under Bashir began arming nomadic Arab raiders to counter an ethnic minority rebellion that broke out in the western Darfur region in 2003.

The groups known as Janjaweed were sent to attack villages on camel and horseback as part of a campaign of terror that saw Bashir indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Criminal Court.

The war in Darfur left hundreds of thousands dead and more than two million displaced.

By 2013, Bashir had appointed him commander of a new force made up of former, mostly Arab, militiamen as Khartoum once again sought to crush the insurgency -- the RSF.

But many in Khartoum looked down at the rise of the Darfuri, who hails from the Arab Rizeigat people.

"The old guard, dominated by the old Sudanese elite around Khartoum, very much view Hemeti as an illiterate, upstart thug whom they first armed to do their dirty work in the war in Darfur," said Alan Boswell, Horn of Africa director at the International Crisis Group.

Closer to power

For nearly a decade, Daglo used his reputation as a ruthless militiaman and street-smart leader to maneuver his way closer to power, all the while growing richer off lucrative RSF-controlled gold mines.

The RSF were deployed in Yemen when Sudan joined the Saudi-led coalition fighting in the civil war there in 2015, in what proved a major boon for both Daglo and his future coup partner, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.

"It allowed him, alongside Burhan, to meet United Arab Emirates officials and Saudi officials and present themselves as possible successors of Bashir," researcher Jerome Tubiana said.

According to experts, the force has also been involved in the conflict in neighbouring Libya.

When the military toppled Bashir in 2019, Daglo became the second most powerful man in the country, but accusations of RSF atrocities continued in the ensuing security crackdown.

When security personnel attacked pro-democracy demonstrators camped out in the heart of the capital in June 2019, it was the RSF that witnesses said were at the forefront of the bloodshed, killing at least 128 people.

Political ambitions

His sights were set still higher, and experts warned he was a man with massive forces at his disposal and lofty political ambitions, whose actions should be closely watched.

Since the coup, Daglo's power has only grown, as he sought to craft a more palatable image -- working on his heavily-accented Arabic, for instance -- while building key alliances.

Though experts have long drawn links between the RSF and Russian mercenary group Wagner, Daglo gained new access as second-in-command, landing in Moscow the day after its invasion of Ukraine.

As the rift with Burhan grew, Daglo came to call the coup he had helped lead a "mistake" that had failed to bring about change and invigorated remnants of Bashir's Islamist regime.

After battles erupted on Saturday -- with fighting still raging through densely-populated streets of Khartoum -- Daglo has portrayed himself and the RSF on social media and international TV as the saviours of Sudan.

In regular posts in both Arabic and English, the RSF claim to be safeguarding democracy against "the putschist forces" led by Burhan, who Daglo slammed as a "criminal" and "a radical Islamist".</text>

    <title>Mulago‚Äôs key machines break down</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/mulago-s-key-machines-break-down-4201920</url>
    <author>[]</author>
    <date>2023-04-17 07:17:12+00:00</date>
    <text>At least 40 essential medical equipment for disease detection and patient management at Mulago National Referral Hospital are non-functional, according to the Auditor General and sources within the hospital.

The country‚Äôs apex public health facility is undergoing infrastructure upgrade despite some of the works being behind schedule, and some of the broken machines were installed five years ago.

Uganda Medical Association (UMA), the national umbrella grouping of doctors, said shortage of equipment for diagnostics and curative care pushes patients to seek services from more expensive private facilities.

As a result, according to the medical officers, patients who cannot afford drop out of treatment, seek less-effective alternatives or die.

The Auditor General in a report covering 2022 indicates that among the ‚Äòdead‚Äô devices are Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine, which cost Euros1.2m (Shs5b) and plain X-ray machine.

MRI is a non-invasive technology that produces three-dimensional body features to help in detection, diagnosis and monitoring of progress of treatment, according to the United States National Institutes of Health, while high energy electromagnetic beams from X-rays penetrate opaque bodies to reveal abnormal masses or tumors.

Other equipment that are broken include ventilators and electronic suction machines for supporting breathing, blood pressure machines and patient monitors.

‚ÄúI carried out an assessment of a sample of 463 key medical equipment in the hospital and noted that 46 were non-functional, four semi-functional and 413 are functional,‚Äù Auditor General John Muwanga notes in the report.

He warned that the absence of such essential medical equipment presents a ‚Äúdaunting task for the medical workers‚Äù in the effective execution of their duties and ‚Äúcompromises the efficiency‚Äù of the workers.

In an interview with this newspaper, Mulago hospital‚Äôs acting Executive Director Dr Rosemary Byanyima, while admitting the problem, said machines do break down but they keep repairing them.

Dr Byanyima blamed the non-functionality on the incomplete renovation works at the facility and limited funds for maintaining the equipment.

‚ÄúAll machines were installed in 2018; some machines may break down like any other machine. And we are lobbying the government to increase funding to maintain the machines because if you buy hi-tech equipment, you need more money to maintain them. The government is giving little money to maintain the equipment,‚Äù she said.

She didn‚Äôt specify the amount they receive from the government for maintaining equipment each year, but other hospital sources said the institution gets Shs6b out of Shs10b.

Mulago hospital management last week expressed concern to Parliament over a proposal to slash the facility‚Äôs medical equipment maintenance budget by Shs3b from the Shs8.2b provisioned in the 2023/2024 Budget Framework Paper.

Dr Herbert Luswata, the UMA secretary general, said unless the chronic maintenance underfunding is addressed, Ugandans should not expect diagnostic and curative care equipment to be functional.

‚ÄúThe non-functional equipment affects the diagnosis. When you get a patient, after taking their history and examining them, you need to do investigations and this includes an accurate and timely diagnosis,‚Äù he said.

He added: ‚ÄúBut most of the time, we are forced to refer the patients to private facilities and then they come back with results. But some investigations are a bit expensive, so when you send them out for diagnosis, they don‚Äôt return or sometimes they return on a later date when their condition is even more severe. Some of them die. Around 50 percent of the patients who come to Mulago hospital cannot pay for some of the diagnoses.‚Äù

MRI scans cost around Shs400,000 to Shs700,000, depending on the facility, the amount which is too high in a country where 34 percent of the population, according to 2020 World Bank records, live on less than Shs7,250 a day.

The scan, according to Dr Zeridah Muyinda, a nuclear medicine physician heading the Radiology Unit of Mulago hospital, is used for diagnosis and monitoring a patient‚Äôs disease.

Dr Muyinda said: ‚Äúwe do a number of investigations ranging from the head, chest, abdomen and genital-urinary system. We diagnose infections and tumours (some cancerous)‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe unit is currently under repair. When functional, the unit can handle 3000 patients per year,‚Äù he said.

Dr Muyinda denied claims that the hospital lacks specialists to operate certain machines. ‚ÄúWe have a nuclear medicine physician, technologists and nurses and a radio pharmacist and a medical physicist. We have eight staff at the moment.‚Äù

The expert said patients who present to them check for breast cancer, thyroid problems, and kidney or other internal organs diseases.

Dr Charles Ayume, chairman of the parliamentary Health Committee, said the lack of functional equipment hampers plans to start organ transplant at Mulago hospital.

Uganda enacted an organ transplant law and the government intends to have the referral hospital pioneer the treatment and cut back on expensive treatment abroad.

‚ÄúIn anticipation of the organ donation and transplant drive, we looked at the Renal Unit of Mulago hospital; the two theatres and we looked at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and we were impressed by the equipment there,‚Äù he said.

Dr Ayume added: ‚ÄúWe also looked at the imaging where we were able to look at the X-rays, ultra-sounds, mammogram, CT scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines. However, here, we were a bit worried because the machines are not functional to full capacity, especially the MRI.‚Äù

The MRI machine is also used to determine the compatibility of the donated organ, according to scientists. Mr Hussein Kassim, a kidney patient at Mulago hospital, said he started dialysis in January last year as he hopes for a kidney transplant.

Mr Kassim said he cannot afford the cost of travelling out of the country to do a kidney transplant.

He told this newspaper that he spends Shs200,000 per visit to access care at Mulago National Referral Hospital, an amount he will have to pay until machines at public hospitals are restored.

‚ÄúI think I got kidney problems because of the medicine which I am taking. I have been taking medicine for diabetes for 20 years. After diabetes, I developed high blood pressure. The service here is excellent. I pay Shs200,000 per visit,‚Äù he said.

Dr Ayume said that for an MRI to function optimally, it has to be in a room which is air-conditioned.

‚ÄúNow Roko has not completed most of the work, especially air conditioning and IT systems. Roko has not completed works to the tune of Shs13b. This includes plumbing, that is why there is no water sometimes at the hospital,‚Äù he said.

Dr Byanyima said they cannot engage engineers to service the MRI machine until Roko Construction Company complete the renovation and suitable room for the equipment.

The rehabilitation works stalled due to cash flow problems and high debt burden that Roko encountered, leading it to run to government that in July 2022 approved Shs207b for the firm as equity.

‚ÄúWhen I call the engineers to service the machine, I want to start working, yet I cannot order the radio nuclei because the lifespan is two weeks only,‚Äù said Dr Byanyima, ‚ÄúIt is until everything is in place that I will want to put in place everything I want to.‚Äù

Last week, Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja told Parliament that they are addressing the issues of non-functional equipment at Mulago hospital.

‚ÄúMulago hospital benefited from renovation (project). Roko was contracted to renovate and upgrade that hospital up to 2018. I don‚Äôt know what forced Roko not to work because I remember we handled Roko here,‚Äù she said, referring to the bail-out cash.

She added: ‚ÄúThe CT scan, the MRI, the mammogram and many other machines (at Mulago hospital) have not been functional because of the room where they were placed; these engineers placed them badly.‚Äù

The premier said she met the hospital officials and the contractors, and agreed that the machines will be installed when Roko completes the behind schedule rehabilitation

Roko officials by press time had not responded to our email inquiries at their request last week.

However, Finance ministry links the ‚Äúdelayed completion of works ‚Ä¶ to various factors including inadequate planning and cash flows, and low mobilisation (materials, equipment and personnel) by the contractor‚Äù.

‚ÄúExpiry of equipment warranties due to delayed completion of civil works and utilisation of delivered equipment [and] poor workmanship characterised by terrazzo, wall finishes and vinyl floor failures in some floor sections of the hospital [also affected the completion of works],‚Äù a budget monitoring report for 2020 reads in part.

According to Dr Byanyima, incomplete works have stymied cross-cutting actions.

‚ÄúWhen the installation of electric systems was incomplete, that cuts across. This is the same for water systems,‚Äù she said.

She added: ‚ÄúThe other issue is the integrated hospital management system and IT system; the intercom is not working and that means people (staff) have to use their airtime to call people in other wards and remember this is a very big institution and the issue can be sorted with intercom. The access control is part of the installations.‚Äù

The access control system would also help the hospital to monitor duty attendance and patient flows.

‚ÄúYou heard of the allegation that people (private facilities) may be bringing in samples from outside to be tested [for free] at Mulago hospital and they take back the results,‚Äù Dr Byanyima said.

‚ÄúSo, how would you monitor? If we had IT backbone in place and we installed our integrated hospital [information] management system, then when you come to the outpatient [department], you are given a number, then you are sent to the lab, your number would be there and it would be in the system,‚Äù she said.

She added: ‚ÄúSo, any sample that comes from out can be easily identified because they won‚Äôt be having our [unique patient] numbers.‚Äù

    <title>Makerere guild aspirant petitions EC after losing with 27 votes</title>

    <text>One of Makerere University guild presidential aspirants in the April 14, 2023 polls has run to the institution's Guild Elections Petition Tribunal seeking to set aside the results announced by the electoral commission.

Mr Hillary Oremo Odwee emerged runner up in the nine-man race after garnering 2,531 votes. He lost to Mr Robert Maseruka with only 27 ballots.

Mr Oremo in his petition, claims that over 6,000 first year students --- a group that he says has majority of his supporters --- were disenfranchised.

‚ÄúThe relegation of first year students from participating in the voting process between the prescribed and notoriously known time period of 8am to 5pm was an act of discrimination basing on their social status, which is a violation of their fundamental human right and dignity,‚Äù the petition read in part.

He further contends that the extension of the voting time announced by the guild electoral commission at exactly 5:34 pm on the voting day, came after the first year students were already psychologically disoriented and had resigned from the entire process.

According to the petitioner, this was a violation of the polling process. History, he said, has it that for the past 10 years, freshers‚Äô voter turn up is usually overwhelming.

Although the EC said Mr Odwee did not get any votes from the Jinja campus, he says he has obrained sworn testimonies from students indicating that he got many votes.

It‚Äôs against this background that he‚Äôs demanding for a re-election to be conducted for only freshers and that the Directorate of ICT (DICT) provides voting results from the Jinja Campus.

In the meantime, he wants the results announced by the EC to be set aside.

If the tribunal does not serve them justice, Mr Odwee has threatened to go to the courts of law.

‚ÄúWe shall go to the courts of law because we are highly dissatisfied with the results of this election,‚Äù he said.

The tribunal‚Äôs secretary, Winfred Kabumbuli acknowledged receipt of the petition in an April 17 notice to all students.

Several freshers said they had been locked out of the e-voting system while others said they were only able to vote after 5pm.

Most of them learnt late that to be able to successfully cast their ballot, they had to disregard one figure (2) from their registration number as they logged into the e-voting system.

The EC chair, Mr Levi Tshilumba told this publication that it was a technical issue beyond his control.

"It was a bit of a technicality, a small technical issue; it is more of something to do with the programming. After a thorough investigation a solution was found and some of them were able to vote,‚Äù he said.</text>

    <text>Explosions rocked the Sudanese capital Khartoum Monday as fighting between the army and paramilitary forces led by rival generals raged for a third day with the death toll surpassing 100.

The violence erupted Saturday after weeks of power struggles between the two generals who seized power in a 2021 coup, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

The conflict has seen air strikes, tanks on the streets, artillery fire and heavy gunfire in crowded neighbourhoods both in Khartoum and other cities across Sudan.

It has triggered international demands for an immediate ceasefire.

On Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres again called on Sudan's warring parties to "immediately cease hostilities". He warned that further escalation "could be devastating for the country and the region."

As the fighting showed no sign of abating, Daglo took to Twitter to call for the international community to intervene against Burhan, branding him a "radical Islamist who is bombing civilians from the air".

"We will continue to pursue Al-Burhan and bring him to justice," said Daglo, whose RSF and its predecessor the Janjaweed in Darfur have previously been accused of atrocities.

"The fight that we are waging now is the price of democracy," he said.

In his only statement since the fighting flared, Burhan told Al Jazeera on Saturday that he was "surprised by Rapid Support Forces attacking his home" and that what was happening "should prevent the formation of forces outside the army".

The conflict has claimed the lives of at least 97 civilians and "dozens" of fighters from both sides, medics said, adding about 942 people have been injured.

But the number of casualties is thought to be far higher, with many wounded unable to reach hospitals due to the danger of movement during fighting.

The doctors' union warned the fighting had "heavily damaged" multiple hospitals in Khartoum and other cities, with some rendered completely "out of service".

The World Health Organization had already warned that several of Khartoum's nine hospitals receiving injured civilians "have run out of blood, transfusion equipment, intravenous fluids and other vital supplies".

UN Special Representative Volker Perthes, who is in Khartoum, said he was "extremely disappointed" by the failure of both sides to abide by an agreed humanitarian pause on Sunday to evacuate the wounded.

The violence has forced terrified people to shelter in their homes with fears of a prolonged conflict that could plunge Sudan into deeper chaos, dashing hopes for return to civilian rule disrupted by the 2021 coup which Burhan and Daglo orchestrated.

Vital aid suspended

The RSF was created under former autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2013. It emerged from the Janjaweed militia that his government unleashed against non-Arab ethnic minorities in Darfur a decade earlier, drawing accusations of war crimes.

The fighting broke out after bitter disagreements between Burhan and Daglo over the planned integration of the RSF into the regular army -- a key condition for a final deal aimed at ending a crisis since the 2021 coup.

The two sides accuse each other of starting the fighting, and both claim to be in control of key sites, including the airport and the presidential palace -- none of which could be independently verified.

On Monday, the army said it was in control of the state broadcaster in the capital's twin city of Omdurman.

After being cut for hours, state television went on the air again, showing footage of soldiers filming themselves on military bases claiming they control them.

Three UN staff from the World Food Programme were among those killed in the western region of Darfur, which WFP said forced a "temporary halt" to all its operations in a country where one-third of the population needs aid.

On Monday morning, loud gunfire and deafening explosions again shook buildings and echoed across the streets of Khartoum as street fighting continued, AFP journalists said.

Power has been off across swathes of the city, and the few grocery stores remaining open warn they will only last a few days if no supplies can enter the city.

Appeals to end the fighting have come from across the region and the globe, including the African Union, Arab League and East African bloc IGAD.

- 'Unprecedented' violence -

Despite the wide calls for a ceasefire, the two generals have appeared in no mood for talks with each one calling the other "criminal".

While Sudan has endured decades of multiple bitter civil wars, coups and rebellions since independence, Sudanese analyst Kholood Khair said the level of fighting inside the capital was "unprecedented".

"This is the first time in Sudan's history -- certainly in its independence history -- that there has been this level of violence in the centre, in Khartoum," she said.

Fighting also raged in other parts of Sudan including Darfur and in the eastern border state of Kassala.

The generals' coup derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of Bashir, triggering international aid cuts and sparked near-weekly protests met by a deadly crackdown.

Burhan, who rose through the ranks under the three-decade rule of now-jailed Bashir, has said the coup "necessary" to include more factions in politics.</text>

    <title>Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, at war with his deputy</title>

    <text>Sudan's army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who became the face of endless military rule in Sudan with his 2021 coup, is now locked in battle with his second-in-command.

To seize power in Sudan's most recent coup, Burhan joined forces with Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, commander of the large and heavily armed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

They have now turned on each other.

At the time, the coup had derailed a fragile transition to civilian rule after the 2019 ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir, and stifled pro-democracy hopes of breaking the cycle of successive coups that has defined Sudan's modern history.

'A veteran soldier'

Born in 1960 in a village north of Khartoum, the moustached Burhan -- known for his signature green beret and military uniform -- remained relatively unknown for most of his career.

"He's never been in the limelight," an army officer, who did not want to be named, told AFP in 2019, as Burhan rose to prominence.

"He's a high-ranking officer within the armed forces, but basically he's a veteran soldier."

Burhan commanded the country's ground forces before Bashir made him inspector general of the army in February 2019, two months before the military removed Bashir from power.

In 2015, he coordinated the deployment of Sudanese troops in Yemen as part of a Saudi-led coalition against the Iran-backed Huthi rebels.

The general worked closely with the heavily armed RSF for operations in Yemen, inadvertently boosting both his and future coup partner Daglo's profile internationally.

It was then with Daglo's support that Burhan got the top job in 2019.

Following Bashir's overthrow, Burhan was sworn in as Sudan's interim leader on April 11, 2019.

In August that year, he was tasked with chairing the ruling Sovereign Council of military and civilian figures, steering the transition to a fully-fledged democracy.

As Sovereign Council chairman -- where he began to switch out military regalia for pinstriped suits -- Burhan cemented Sudan's ties with global powers and regional players, including the United States and Israel.

In February 2020, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda, breaking with longtime convention and to start a process of normalisation of ties.

He also maintained close relationships with influential northern neighbour Egypt.

Though the general has also made several trips to rich Gulf countries -- on whose largesse impoverished Sudan has often depended -- experts note that his deputy-turned-rival Daglo often beat him to each visit.

Political crisis

By October 25, 2021, all pretence of post-Bashir civilian transition was abandoned when Burhan took to national TV in the middle of the night.

In one fell swoop, he dissolved the transitional government, arrested civilian leaders and installed himself in power, with Daglo as his right-hand man.

Spiralling political and economic turmoil proved unsustainable for Burhan, who in July of last year made a surprise vow "to make room for political and revolutionary forces and other national factions" to form a civilian government.

The apparent concession from the coup leader -- met with scepticism from pro-democracy activists -- launched a shaky-footed political process that culminated in a framework agreement, signed in December.

With experts pointing to internal pressures on Burhan to nip Daglo's ambitions in the bud, the army chief sought to use the political process to curtail the RSF's autonomy.</text>

    <title>Health workers demand Shs1.9b for Ebola work</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/health-workers-demand-shs1-9b-for-ebola-work-4201966</url>

    <date>2023-04-17 08:03:06+00:00</date>
    <text>Up to 83 health workers, who were involved in the management of Ebola patients in the recent outbreak, have said they were not paid their salary and allowances to the tune of Shs1.9 billion.

According to a letter by health workers‚Äô lawyers, Makmot Kibwanga & Company Advocates, to the permanent secretary in the Health ministry, they are demanding that government clears them within 14 days.

‚Äú‚Ä¶the accumulated emoluments inclusive of salaries of the above categories of cadres for 7 months is a total of shs1.74billion and arrears of per diem of shs222 million making total shs1.96 billion,‚Äù the April 14 letter reads in part.

The lawyers claim that their clients attempted to have the Ministry of Health pay them through various fora in vain.

The issue of non-payment comes three months after this newspaper reported the World Health Organisation (WHO) official, Mr Jerry Jonas, as saying Shs154 billion meant for Ebola response from development partners remained unspent.

Dr Diana Atwine, the permanent secretary of the Health ministry, did not respond to our repeated calls and text message when reached for comments.

However, Mr Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the spokesperson of the Health ministry, said he was still verifying the claim but he did not get back by press time.

The affected workers, according to the lawyers, include 13 medical doctors, five clinical officers, 20 nursing officers, 25 assistant nursing officers, one nursing assistant, one psychiatric nurse, 11 enrolled nurses, three medical lab technologists, three lab technicians, and two medical social workers.

In the September 2022 Ebola outbreak, which raised anxiety among the population, infected 142 people, killed 56 but 86 recovered, according to statistics from the Health ministry.

The lawyers said in their demand notice that the health workers were variously approached on phone and invited to go and serve in the management of the Ebola epidemic, the call to which they heeded.

‚Äú...our clients were deployed in Mubende Ebola hotspots and epicentre from October 22, 2022 to November 24, 2022 without any employment contract,‚Äù the letter reads further.

The letter continues: ‚Äú...you (the Ministry of Health) and them, then executed employment contracts for ‚ÄòLocal Non Gratuitable‚Äô contract as medical workers for a period of six months from November 25, 2022 to May 25, 2023.‚Äù

Uganda was declared Ebola-free in January this year but the contract of the workers, according to the lawyers, is still running until May.

‚Äú...since the execution of the contract you demobilized our clients on the 11th of January 2023 without re-deploying them to work elsewhere when you closed the Ebola Treatment Centre but left the contract running and salaries unpaid,‚Äù the letter reads.

The lawyers said their clients were never paid the first month from October22 to November 24, 2022, except per diem for two months of November‚ÄìDecember 2022, which was paid by the World Health Organisation.

    <text>The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Justice Jane Frances Abodo, has said the ongoing file perusal and prosecution of Cabinet ministers involved in iron sheets scandal is going well.

So far, the office of the DPP is prosecuting Karamoja Affairs minister Mary Goretti Kitutu and is scheduled to prosecute two more this week including State minister for Planning who spent the weekend in police cells.

‚ÄúI have not reached the point where I am so stressed that I cannot sleep, I have not reached that point yet, not even the iron sheets scandal, I go home and sleep,‚Äù Justice Abodo said on Saturday during the launch of the Female Lawyers Network in Kampala.

Last week, officials from the office of the chief government prosecutor said they had received eight more police files for perusal and possible sanctioning of those with sufficient evidence.

The files, according to those privy to the investigations, involve Cabinet ministers and ministry technocrats.

Up to 22 ministers, 31 MPs and 13 district administrative officers have been implicated in the iron sheets scandal, including top government officials such as Vice President Jessica Alupo, Speaker of Parliament Anita Among and Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja.

The Female Lawyers Network‚Äôs vision is to empower women in law and the girl child in a gender-equal and just world. The group also aims at eradicating gender injustices across age groups and sectors in the legal profession.

Ms Joyce Nalunga, the founder and president of the Female Lawyers Network, said: ‚ÄúWe believe in eradicating gender injustices across age groups and sectors in the legal profession through engagement and awareness with women and girls to promote women‚Äôs rights, foster good governance.‚Äù</text>

    <text>A young man wearing a niqab and glasses played four rounds of the Nairobi Women's Chess Open before being exposed.

"I don't think anything like it has ever happened anywhere in the world," said John Mukabi, secretary general of the Kenyan Chess Federation.

Mukabi said that after the imposter was unmasked he explained that he had done it because he had a better chance of winning the women's competition prizemoney.

The 31st Kenya Open, an international chess competition in Nairobi from April 6-10, attracted 445 participants, with 84 entries in the women's tournament.

One veiled player, silent and elusive, attracted increasing suspicion as the rounds progressed.

"The first hint that there was something wrong was when I went around with a photographer to take pictures of the competition," Mukabi told AFP on Sunday.

"When we went back to the computer to put in the names, the name was Milicent Awour. We were expecting a Muslim name. It was a bit odd but it is possible that there are people with Christian names who are Muslims."

He said match officials were also developing doubts.

"The arbiters also noticed something: after games, this person disappears and only comes back with a few minutes to the start of the next round," said Mukabi.

"Somebody also noticed that the shoulders looked more male than female... Even the rubber shoes he was wearing, they were mostly associated with men."

The mystery competitor was also scoring good results.

"The other thing is he had defeated a very experienced lady, who participated six times in the World Chess Olympiad for Kenya," said Mukabi.

After round four, the officials made their move. It was checkmate in one.

"After that game, the arbiters took him aside and one female arbiter went with him to the washrooms where he was asked to remove the hijab. On reaching there, he immediately just admitted that he was a male. He was withdrawn and the scores reversed."

"He said financial problems led him to do that," said Mukabi. "In the men's section, he had no chance at all, we had Grand Masters, International Masters..."</text>

    <title>My Ebola Story: I disowned relatives, but caught the virus</title>

    <text>Sumayiya Nalubowa, a 30-year-old resident of Kaweeri Village in East Division, Mubende Municipality, and an Ebola virus survivor, says she contracted the disease from her three-year-old young brother Shakim Kavuma.

Kavuma was living with his mother Annet Nampenjja in Ngabano‚ÄìMadudu. Nampenjja is a stepmother of Nalubowa.

Nalubowa says her little brother fell sick with a strange disease in September 2022. The boy was at first taken to a traditional healer in Madudu by his mother who claimed the boy was bleeding from the mouth because of witchcraft. The healer said the boy‚Äôs tongue had to be cut to stop the bleeding.

‚ÄúThe boy‚Äôs tongue was cut at the bottom and he immediately stopped bleeding; however after some time, the boy‚Äôs condition worsened and he was taken to Mubende Hospital,‚Äù she says.

When Kavuma was admitted to Mubende Hospital, her stepmother called asking her to help and provide support and care since she (Nalubowa) stayed near the hospital.

Kavuma was diagnosed with malaria and was put on oxygen. At that time, the announcement of an Ebola outbreak had not been made.

After spending two days in the hospital, Nampenjja also fell sick and was admitted to the women‚Äôs ward.

‚ÄúAt that time, I had stopped returning to my home in Kaweeri to see my family and only focused on caring for my little brother in the children‚Äôs ward. My father, Ismail Kavuma, was also taking care of my stepmother in the women‚Äôs ward,‚Äù she says.

On the third day at the hospital, her 12-year-old sister Zaina Nakalyango was also brought to the hospital bleeding from the nose and mouth. Nalubowa now had two patients to care for. Her focus now changed to her sister who was in a critical condition and was vomiting blood.

While at the hospital, she says they started hearing rumours that there was a new disease spreading through the area, which made people bleed through their nose and mouth. Some samples were taken from people who had died after presenting symptoms similar to those associated with Ebola to establish what the problem could be.

‚ÄúOn September 19, Ebola rumours spread across the hospital and people started staring and pointing at us, whispering, but I ignored them because I had no idea of what was transpiring. The nurses stopped attending to my sister and brother,‚Äù she says.

Nalubowa narrates that all the health workers who used to work on the patients started avoiding them. They would stand far away and direct her to do all sorts of work health workers were supposed to do.

What hurt her was that even the nurses who knew how dangerous the matter was did not alert her. They just shunned going near them. It was only later in the day that a female doctor came and told her not to touch either patient again without using gloves.

‚ÄúI was scared at times and started hiding from my sister. She could call my name, yearning for water. At times, I could throw a bottle of water toward her, and avoid going near her. I would hide from her because I didn‚Äôt want her to see and call me and then I refuse to go; it would have broken her heart,‚Äù she says.

Throughout the interview, Nalubowa breaks down in tears.

On September 20, the Ministry of Health declared an Ebola outbreak in Mubende. The health workers then started moving from ward to ward and selecting patients with signs such as those of Ebola. Nalubowa‚Äôs siblings were isolated.

Seeing health workers covered in coveralls, something she had never seen before, scared her to the marrow. So she left the ward.

However, some people had seen her and known the patients she was taking care of and pointed that out. But she said she didn‚Äôt know the patients they were taking off.

‚ÄúWhen Ebola was declared, I was so scared because my patients were the first suspects. A doctor called me asking for information about the three patients I was in touch with, my little brother, sister and step-mother, but I denied them.

‚ÄúI remember I told the doctor that I only knew the husband of the lady and provided him with the contact information of my father. I then walked back straight to my home in deep fear and explained everything to my husband. He took our son to our nearby neighbours since I had become a key suspect,‚Äù she says.

The tests on the three people returned positive on September 22. They were then transferred to the Ebola treatment unit. That very day Nalubowa‚Äôs father fell sick, but he didn‚Äôt reveal to the health workers how he was feeling.

On September 23, her sister Nakalyango passed away, but Nalubowa kept the news of her sister‚Äôs death to herself. She did not let her neighbours know because she feared they could suspect her.

‚ÄúMy sister was buried the following day on Saturday by a safe and dignified burial team. The body was brought late in the evening and buried at around 8pm, but we were not allowed to attend the burial or even come near,‚Äù she says.

After her sister‚Äôs burial, her father‚Äôs condition worsened; however, he refused to accept that he had Ebola and the health workers were forced to go along with police to evacuate him.

A few days after, Nalubowa‚Äôs father tested positive for Ebola, she also fell sick. She went to a clinic in Kaweeri for treatment; however despite the efforts made to help her and changes in the treatment she did not get better.

Noticing that there was no change in her condition, Nalubowa was taken to Mubende Hospital and admitted to the emergency ward where all Ebola suspects were isolated.

‚ÄúI was given a dose of treatment which made me feel better. Later in the day, one of the men asked me whether I was an Ebola patient or suspect because that place was designated for Ebola suspects, but I told him that I was not,‚Äù she says.





Escape mission

In the morning she sneaked out of the ward and planned how to escape from the hospital. She decided to wait for darkness to fall.

‚ÄúI picked my bag and moved out of the hospital slowly. I walked straight home and did not use a boda boda thinking that I may be traced. Unfortunately after reaching home, I got worse and I was forced to go back to the clinic where I had got treatment at first,‚Äù she reveals.

Nalubowa later left the clinic and went to a hospital nearby. She asked the team at the hospital whether they could do all types of tests, including that of Ebola, but they told her that they could not test for Ebola. They also told her that they didn‚Äôt believe there was Ebola and that the government and health officials were doing all that because they wanted financial support from various countries.

While there, she tested positive for malaria. She was given treatment and returned home the following day.

That evening, her condition worsened and her husband took her back to Mubende Hospital. She was admitted again in the emergency room designated for Ebola suspects. She discovered that they had started searching for her.

Her sample and that of others were collected and taken for testing. Two days later, the results were back.

‚ÄúA doctor came into the ward covered in overalls and read out my name. Because of the fear, I did not reply, but the doctor kept on shouting my name and finally I responded in a low voice. He started convincing me to go to another room because they wanted space in the room I was in.

‚Äò‚ÄòI then heard the doctor speaking to a nurse, telling her: ‚ÄòShe tested positive for Ebola and we want her away from her colleagues, she might infect them.‚Äô‚Äù

She asked the doctor if it was true she had Ebola as he [doctor] was alleging, but the doctor said no and that they only wanted to shift all the patients who came on Thursday starting with her. Nalubowa says she accepted to do what he asked, but started planning to escape again.

‚ÄúOn the very day I was taken to the Ebola treatment unit, I still had some energy because of the treatment I had received. As I had done during my first escape, I waited till night to execute my plan, but I was caught before reaching the hospital gate and taken back,‚Äù she reveals.

During her second day in the unit, her condition worsened and all the serious symptoms presented.

‚ÄúI started vomiting blood. I had diarrhoea, and was bleeding from my nose. I started urinating dark thick urine, yellow in color and lost my appetite. That‚Äôs when my understanding stopped and I went into a coma,‚Äù she says.

Nalubowa says she regained her consciousness after four days. By that time, most of the patients thought she was dead.

At the beginning, the patients would be required to wear polythene bags to manage the diarrhea, but as the condition improved they were given adult pampers.

Five people were infected with Ebola virus disease from Nalubowa‚Äôs family, and one person died.





Stigma

When asked why she did not want to go to the hospital to get help, and why she kept trying to escape, Nalubowa says she was afraid to be told that she actually had Ebola.

She worried that if she had it, she would not recover and felt it was better not to know. There were also allegations that Ebola was not real, so sometimes she was not sure what to believe.

Nalubowa adds that the information she heard on radio and TV, as well as the way the public perceived the information made her fear being admitted.

She was discharged from Mubende Hospital after recovering, but faced a lot of stigma.

At one point, the village committee surrounded her home ordering her to go back to the hospital saying she still had the virus and might infect the village. That really traumatised her.

Nalubowa, however, still feels body pain whenever she does any heavy work. She claims that the Ebola survivors‚Äô clinic is not helping them as they thought it should, saying that even when one falls sick, they are referred to the general hospital.

‚ÄúI once fell sick and made a call to the survivors‚Äô clinic updating them on my condition, but I was told that it was not my day to visit the clinic. However, they asked me to go if I could. It was 9am when I got there, but it got to 6pm without being attended to yet the healthcare workers were around,‚Äù she says.

She wonders if her name was removed from the list because she last visited the clinic in November last year and has not received a call to go for a check, and yet ‚Äúyou are only meant to visit when the nurses call you according to their time table‚Äô‚Äô.

Nalubowa, however, applauds the health workers who cared for them, providing treatment, keeping them clean, washing their clothes, and bathing them. She is grateful to have her life back.













ABOUT ebola

It is a deadly virus with initial symptoms which can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. Subsequent stages can include vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding, known as haemorrhaging. The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Symptoms of Ebola can sometimes be confused with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.</text>

    <title>Onencan makes devices to ease read for the visually impaired</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/education/onencan-makes-devices-to-ease-read-for-the-visually-impaired-4202454</url>
    <author>['Daily Monitor']</author>
    <date>2023-04-17 13:22:53+00:00</date>
    <text>While at Naalya Secondary School, Douglas Onencan started Mother Naalya Outreach Foundation. It was a foundation that allowed students to interact with communities for exposure. In the first community outreach, Onencan and other students visited Kikaaya Village in Bweyogerere, a Kampala suburb.

He interacted with a girl who did not have hands but used her legs to write. The sight of the visually impaired glued in one place and others with different disabilities touched Onencan. He wished he could help the disabled.

Passion

When he joined ISBAT University in 2021 to study Computer Science in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) department, one of the assignments was to make a problem-solving project. It was not a new challenge. In 2018, while president of the Science Club at Naalya Secondary School, Onencan designed a self-sufficient electric car concept that did not require recharging. Earlier in 2016, in Senior Three at Busoga College Mwiri, he researched about hydrogen as fuel of the future with the aim of making it available to meet fuel needs, including homes. The school supported the research up to the testing stage. He failed at making parts needed to make the system safe for use because of limited resources.

‚ÄúArtificial intelligence is a vast and open field that requires creativity. After acquiring knowledge about computer vision, object recognition, path planning and finding, all using the camera, depth finding, text to speech and speech to text, voice synthesis and natural language processing, there was much I could have done but I remembered the community of the visually impaired at Kikaaya. I got the idea of the artificial eye,‚Äù the 24-year-old explains.

Designing the artificial eye

Onencan says the first step involved knowing how the visually impaired live and gathering information on different aspects in their daily life. This was followed by developing four machine learning modules, each serving different functions.

The second step was testing and evaluation using a computer with more capabilities and the last step was deployment from the computer to a single board device to deploy outside the world.

The white small casing on the glass arm has a raspberry pi camera. The camera has modules which are integrated into a rectangular universal serial bus (USB) hub. Inside the hub is a USB sound card that has power systems, which is why it has one line.

‚ÄúEverything in the casing is communicated to the hub the user fixes on their belt. The sound output is in the headset which the visually impaired wears like earphones.

It took me eight months to develop because of financial challenges. Had I had resources, it would have taken me four months. A lot of time is spent on understanding the problem,‚Äù he says.

The eyebyorets device

Code-named eyebyorets, split into three, the device has the eye, by and orets. Orets is a company Onencan dreams to start to produce devices after school that help to read materials for the visually impaired. Eyebyorets is an artificial intelligence glass-powered device that offers functions of a human eye. It has other machine-learning modules such as object recognition, colours, size and mobility possibility to help in case the user is stuck. The artificial intelligence part comes in decision-making, depending on what the machine learning module produces.

The book-reading module reads physical and online books.

The device is used by two categories of the disabled; the visually impaired regardless of the level of impairment, and the completely blind. It helps them have the ability to recognise what is around them and walk without a human guide.

‚ÄúDuring development, the biggest research goal was independence. For instance, looking after someone is full time a job. If the person being taken care of wants something, the caretaker acknowledges the need. However, some caretakers get tired, become stubborn and deny the dependant what they want even if it‚Äôs close. With this device, all that is pushed to the back and it allows the user independence to walk and see what is around them.

AI career opportunities

Henry Semakula, a lecturer of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at ISBAT University, says when his students graduate, they have to be able to do tangible projects from which they do not only make money, but also solve common problems.

‚ÄúWe live in modern societies of information technology and computers. AI graduates should think deeply about making gadgets that make life easy for different categories of people. There are many society problems such as climate change that the present and future technology should solve because the world is advancing at a fast pace,‚Äù Semakula explains.

Advice to parents

Jimmy Obira, a lecturer of robotics and internet of things (IOT) at the same university, says it is important for parents to understand that the world is going through many technological evolutions, the more reason you (parent) need to support children to study technological courses. AI and machine learning are new areas that are expected to take over the world in future.

‚ÄúTechnological courses will help to support different work fields. In the health sector, there are few cancer specialists. You can run an artificial intelligence module or machine learning algorithm that can help doctors to diagnose patients quickly by taking images of, say, cancer cells and train a module to analyse and compare an infected person and one who is not infected. Time will come when people without a technology background will run out of jobs. The earlier you support children to study these courses, the better for their future,‚Äù Obira says.

    <text>For the fifth time, the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) programme held their graduation with 85 women entrepreneurs from Kampala, Lira, and Arua, building businesses in agriculture, education, health, technology, and tourism. This was courtesy of the US Embassy and ShonaGroup for the women who made the grade.

The US Embassy department of State‚Äôs Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) started AWE in partnership between Arizona State University‚Äôs Thunderbird School of Global Management and global copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan, to provide women entrepreneurs with the knowledge, networks, and access they require to establish and expand their businesses as a programme supporting the development of women entrepreneurs around the world.

While speaking at the graduation ceremony, Ellen Masi, the US Embassy Public Diplomacy counsellor, said there is need for constant support of the programme.

‚ÄúThe department of State continues to support the AWE programme because the US government considers the advancement of inclusive economic growth and opportunities for all Ugandans, particularly women entrepreneurs, a crucial priority,‚Äù Masi said.

She implored the graduates to remember that they have the power to create jobs, drive economic growth, and inspire others to follow in their footsteps.

After impacting different regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean, AWE spread its wings to Africa with the primary objective of promoting women‚Äôs economic empowerment, one of the US Policies. The programme was also designed to support the White House-led Women‚Äôs Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (W-GDP), which empowers women worldwide to fulfil their economic potential, creating conditions for increased stability, security, and prosperity for all.

Ellen Masi, the US Embassy Public Diplomacy counsellor gives her keynote speech at the AWE graduation.

Also, the programme is aimed at being a flexible education opportunity for dynamic women to learn how to develop and grow their businesses. It is centred around the online training programme on women‚Äôs entrepreneurship. Since inception in Uganda, the AWE programme has been a great success and has been instrumental in growing women‚Äôs entrepreneurship in Uganda while helping participants grow their businesses, and many have gone on to secure funding and create jobs.

How training happened

On the other hand, Shona collaborated with the US Embassy to implement the fifth cohort of the programme that launched in November 2022. Throughout the programme, the selected entrepreneurs from Kampala, Lira, and Arua districts learned from a combination of the online DreamBuilder programme and expert facilitators who led in-person sessions. The training was done using interactive and creative methods of learning, and the impact of the programme on the participant‚Äôs skill level was continually assessed. This is the second time Shona is implementing the AWE programme in partnership with the US Embassy.

Support

Speaking during the graduation ceremony, Joachim Ewechu, Shona Group co-founder and CEO, highlighted how economically empowering women can benefit Uganda as a country.

‚ÄúThe AWE programme is a highly impactful initiative that supports promising women entrepreneurs in Uganda to grow for long-term success. We believe that investing in women entrepreneurs is critical for economic growth and development in Uganda and on the continent. We are proud and committed to supporting women entrepreneurs in Uganda and other countries, and we look forward to implementing more successful programmes in the future in partnership with the US Embassy in Uganda,‚Äù he said.

On top of acquiring new knowledge and skills from the programme, the graduates also learned from their peers who were exposed to US models for business development and will qualify to apply for funding from the United States African Development Foundation (USADF). They will be able to access investments between Shs3.5m and Shs35m from Shona Capital, a debt fund.

Additionally, the graduates officially become alumni of US government exchange programmes joining other AWE Alumni and fellows from various programmes at the US Embassy. Since 2013, Shona has worked with more than 500 SMEs and 2,000 entrepreneurs in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda across multiple sectors, including agriculture, financial services, health care, education, manufacturing, water and sanitation, and energy. These businesses have grown to create more than 1,700 jobs and collectively raise over $33m in investment.

Facilitators

Some of the experts who facilitated this programme included Charity Kamusiime, an experienced marketing Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the telecommunications, advertising, and financial services industry.

Augustine Mwanje , a certified entrepreneur trainer and consultant with the Regent University (USA) international networks of Business Development Centres. Over 500 entrepreneurs in 35 industries from start-ups to well-established businesses have relied on his expertise as a consultant and coach to help them grow and prosper.

Hadijah Nakkanja, founder of Community Women‚Äôs Enterprise Network Uganda (CWEN), a business resource space for women entrepreneurs in the agro-processing sector.

Their goal is to support high-potential women entrepreneurs to gain shelf space in leading local and regional stores by strengthening the capacity of women food entrepreneurs through a co-shared processing and production facility, packaging, branding, marketing, merchandising, and promotion.

    <title>How to write a user story? 4 tools to help you with it</title>

    <text>User Stories are undoubtedly the most used tool for gathering agile requirements. Regardless of the Agile Method you use, a list of User stories is practically a prerequisite. Today they are undoubtedly of great importance for any Product Owner - but does every PO or Product Manager know how to write a user story?

A very common question surrounding user stories is: why should we write them? During the development of a product, teams need guidance on what our business needs are, and what should be built.

But this alone is insufficient for the development of the best solution possible, as it can be interpreted in many different ways by the team, impacting final delivery to the user.

More information and context is required for our developers. They need to know who they are developing each functionality for: who is my user? What are they like? What are their pain points and needs? We also need to explore why my user wants the solution in question: what do they hope to achieve with it? What are their expectations?

User stories function as a narrative about what, to whom and why each functionality should be delivered. As such, they are a driver for development.

What to consider before writing a user story

Certain techniques are recommended, such as 3W ‚Äì ‚Äúwho, what and why‚Äù ‚Äì and the 3C technique ‚Äì ‚Äúcard, conversation and confirmation‚Äù.

Writing a user story is very simple, and involves following the model presented below, using relevant information:

How ‚Äì author of the action (persona);

I want ‚Äì desired functionality;

For ‚Äì added value to the desired functionality.

When using the 3W technique, for example, we must pay attention to who our subject or user is. In other words, how the user considers themselves (persona), what they want to do, and why they want to perform the activity in question. Returning to the model presented above:

How (who?) ‚Äì who am I building this feature for? Who is the persona identified by this story?

I want (what?) ‚Äì what is the expected functionality? What does the persona want to accomplish?

For (why?) ‚Äì what is the motivation for building this story? What value does the user expect?

The 3C technique, on the other hand, proceeds as follows:

Card ‚Äì a user story should not be overly long, and should fit on a single card;

Conversation ‚Äì the content should generate discussions among the team about what objectives you want to meet;

Confirmation ‚Äì the user story should include acceptance criteria, thus enabling successful validation in both construction and delivery.

Certain tools and templates can be used by product professionals when writing user stories, like a free flowchart maker, which helps to develop a visual guide to the process so everyone on the team can understand it step clearly.

Focus on the customer / end user, and use personas

The focus should always be on what your customer, or end user, wants. If for some reason you are not focused on your user, or do not even know who your user is, then your user stories will most likely add nothing to your product or project.

To write good user stories, the focus should be on the end-user customer, and not on what you think they want.

If you do not yet know your customer, then using personas will definitely help. Personas are characters that represent your client; in other words, a character that has the same characteristics and desires as your end user.

Products typically have more than one persona, which makes things easier. A good tip is to combine personas with story-mapping.

User Stories are informal and should represent business value

User Stories are informal and only serve to represent the wishes of your users and customers. To write good user stories, think of them as informal conversations, which are subject to change.

These stories must have a reason to exist. User stories are often created without considering the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. So make the business value of each one abundantly clear.

Some helpful tools

Here are some points that need to be defined, and techniques that can be used to assist in the user story writing process:

1 ‚Äì INVEST technique: this acronym contains the six main characteristics to be considered during the creation, definition and writing of a user story:

Independent ‚Äì no dependencies or ties to other stories;

Negotiable ‚Äì the story should be subject to adjustment if necessary, depending on changes of context or new team evaluations;

Valuable ‚Äì should deliver value to the end user;

Estimable ‚Äì has enough information for the team to understand and estimate next steps;

Sized ‚Äì the story should be small, and generate as few uncertainties as possible, as part of an iteration;

Testable ‚Äì it should be possible to define individual functionality tests based on the story.

2 ‚Äì Acceptance criteria: These are like checklists that must be considered to ensure that each story is delivering what was requested and planned during its definition, in terms of functionality and delivering value to the user.

These criteria work as a detail concerning what should be delivered in each story, and help developers in the definition and planning of tests. There is no correct way to write these acceptance criteria - they can take the form of topics, or descriptions of possible usage scenarios.

3 ‚Äì Definition of scenarios in user stories + BDD: one way of writing these acceptance criteria is through the definition of scenarios that can help to develop user stories.

These scenarios map the potential paths of product usage, culminating in the success or failure of a given task. This helps developers to deal with unforeseen and alternative paths.

A helpful development technique here is referred to as BDD, or Behavior Driven Development.

This technique lets developers describe the expected behavior for the functionality to be implemented, and validate the construction of the story based on this behavior.

The three keywords for this purpose are:

Given (provides context for the scenario);

When (specifies the action being performed);

Then (represents the desired outcome).

Some further descriptors can be added:

Given (some initial context);

And (some further context);

When (the primary action or event);

And (some further action or event);

Then (initial outcome);

And (further outcome).

4 ‚Äì Defining tasks for user stories: the tasks that are part of user stories - i.e. the tasks required for the construction of each feature - need to be defined as well.

These refinements take place at a developmental level, usually defined by the development team itself, and state what needs to be done in direct, technical language.

As for how these tasks should be described, there are no rules, except that they should be objective and clear, acting as a kind of implementation script.

The description of user stories should be written in an objective, agile and simple manner. The aim is to simply state the functionalities that the system will have, devoid of technical details.

Whenever it makes sense to build these stories, they will go through a refinement process with the whole team, before other important points for its development are added: acceptance criteria, test scenarios, technical details, etc.

When writing a user story, be sure to answer the three main questions, to ensure understanding and an assertive construction phase.

Concern yourself with understanding the context of the user and the business, and communicating this clearly to your team at a business level, rather than in technical terms. That is why it is so important to learn how to write a user story.

    <title>Where the Scene Is Headed: Ugandan Football Is Alive and Kicking</title>

    <text>Although Uganda has never qualified for the World Cup, it is experiencing a resurgence in continental and club-level football. A decade ago, the state of football in Uganda was far less promising.

Due to longstanding internal conflicts between the Federation of Uganda Football Associations (FUFA) and some of its most influential clubs, as well as incidents of match-fixing and economic challenges, supporters and sponsors have justifiably abandoned the organization in recent years.

FUFA's reputation had reached an all-time low, with the general public expressing little confidence in the organization, while football enthusiasts in Uganda increasingly gravitated towards the English Premier League and eplfantasy leagues.

What is the current state of Ugandan football?

As of right now, Ugandan football appears to be flourishing and achieving greater success at the international level. The national U20 male team qualified for the 2023 U-20 Africa Cup, while the senior women's national team won the CECAFA competition and secured a spot in the African Women‚Äôs Cup. In recent times, Uganda has taken significant strides towards establishing itself as a rising dominant force in the global arena of football.

The fanbase for football in Uganda has been steadily growing, as improved relationships between enthusiasts and club management have led to increased engagement from sponsors. Currently, there are more than 40 sponsors engaged with the UPL, as the sport seeks to restore its reputation. Domestic football in Uganda is thriving, with many regions across the country experiencing a revival of interest in the sport, beyond just the greater city of Kampala, where football has traditionally been most prevalent.

Indeed, there are a number of current issues facing football in Uganda, such as concerns regarding players' welfare. However, there has been a notable shift in the perception of the sport at the national level in recent years, with a growing appreciation for its cultural and economic significance.





Coexistence of EPL and UPL

In addition to the increased interest in Ugandan football, there appears to be a more balanced coexistence between the EPL and UPL, according to marketing professionals. Passionate fans of the sport now prefer to attend live football events in Uganda, rather than watching EPL games on television, which was not the case in previous years.

There is also a growing sense of "culture" among football fandoms in Uganda, with a strong ritualistic element to their identities and a deep sense of pride associated with supporting a particular team.

Wearing the shirts of one's favorite team has become an increasingly popular practice among football fans in Uganda, partly due to a local "wear your local jersey" initiative and other promotional campaigns. Fans are also showing a greater willingness to spend money on merchandise, and there is a growing demand for detailed information such as player and team statistics, which is particularly relevant for those who bet on the sport.





Uganda is not the only African country experiencing a football revolution of sorts, as similar developments have been observed in Tanzania, Rwanda, and many other countries. Furthermore, it is not just the football market that is expanding in Uganda; the entire sports sector is experiencing growth, including basketball, rugby, boxing, and other sports.

With many sponsors beginning to regain trust in the football sector and renewing their engagements, it is clear that this is one of the key drivers behind the rapid growth of the industry as a whole.

In conclusion, it is clear that Ugandan football, despite its difficult past, is alive and well and poised to continue growing in popularity alongside other sports in the future.

Despite the strained relationship between the public and private sports sectors in Uganda in the past, they are now beginning to rebuild trust and establish a more professional working connection.

This is due in part to the growing enthusiasm among fans, who are developing a strong culture around supporting their teams, betting on the sport, and buying merchandise. As a result, the future of sports in Uganda is looking increasingly promising.</text>

    <text>A four-year-old boy and a Uganda People‚Äôs Defence Forces (UPDF) soldier died in a Monday road crash in Kasese District in western Uganda.

The 12:30pm crash happened at Nyamwamba West cell, Nyamwamba Division along Nyakasanga Road.

The traffic police spokesperson, ASP Faridah Nampiima said the driver of a speeding UPDF Toyota Land Cruiser knocked down Bira Linius, a resident of Nyamwamba West Acholi quarters in Kasese District, as he crossed the road before the driver lost control and rammed into a nearby house.

Pte Fred Mawadri attached to Rukoki Barracks under mountain brigade who was seated behind the truck was crushed to death by the falling debris, according to police.

‚ÄúThe suspected cause of the accident has been attributed to speeding and careless crossing of the road by the juvenile. The two bodies were conveyed to Kasese Hospital for postmortem examination. Further investigations into the accident are underway,‚Äù ASP Nampiima said.

Fuso truck rams into six motorcycles

In a related development, a boda boda rider was killed at Masanafu along the Kampala Northern bypass expressway after a Fuso truck rammed into six motorcycles.

The deceased was identified as Innocent Taremwa, a resident of Kamwokya, a Kampala suburb following the 11:50am crash.

‚ÄúThe deceased was riding motorcycle registration number 486S. Eight others sustained serious injuries and were rushed to different medical centers for treatment. Investigations into the cause of the accident are underway,‚Äù ASP Nampiima said Monday.

This comes just days after police said on April 11 that at least 200 people were reported dead in road crashes in Uganda in just two weeks, 37 of whom were killed in the three days of Easter season.</text>

    <title>Mbale has highest number of street children - survey</title>

    <date>2023-04-17 10:38:48+00:00</date>
    <text>Mbale has the highest number of street children compared to other Cities, with Jinja contributing 2.5 percent of their total number countrywide, according to latest findings.

This was revealed at the weekend during the International Day for Street Children held in Jinja, which is one of the Cities challenged by street children.

The celebrations drew several organisations working with street children across the country, including Children at Risk Action Network, Frontline Social Work Organisation, Uganda Change Agent Association, Jinja Connect, and Rescue Foundation for Children among others.

Mr Robert Sanyu, from Kampala-based Rescue Foundation for Children, said research conducted in 2022 indicates that Mbale has the highest number of street children because it is one of the corridors through which they access other cities like Jinja and Kampala, yet it (Mbale) has few organisations to address such issues.

‚ÄúThere are about 16,000 children on the streets across the country, with Jinja contributing about 400 (2.5 percent),‚Äù Mr Sanyu said at the weekend.

Mr Fred Mabonga from the National Children Authority, who represented the Executive Director Mr Martin Kiiza, said last year, the government through the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, came up with a plan to review the National Street Children Strategy (2008).

Mr Mabonga said the review, which involved meetings with stakeholders, aimed at securing a consultant to come up with a report on how many children are living in the City and Town streets in the country, and where they are coming from among other findings.

While some street children, especially from Karamoja Sub-region, were pushed to city streets by poverty, others, especially those born in Kampala, found themselves on the streets because of domestic violence or loss of parents.

The government, through the Ministry of GLSD has stepped up efforts to evict all children from city streets and take them to rehabilitation centres; however, the majority of them are not willing to leave and thus end up in city slums.

Violence on streets

Several children who testified on behalf of their colleagues complained of the alleged high-handedness by police and other law enforcement agencies, which they accused of brutality, while another child said some adult colleagues subject them to acts of homosexuality.

Findings from an enumeration of street children carried out in 2019 by Retrak Uganda in collaboration with the Gender ministry and Uganda Bureau of Statistics (Ubos) showed that there were more than 2,600 children living on streets between the age of 7 and 17 years, while 1,410 children aged between 7 and 17 years were estimated to be working on streets.

The in-charge of the Child Family Protection Unit at Jinja Police Station, Ms Cissy Logose, said many factors push children away from their biological parents and relatives to the street, including death of parents and are left with relatives or stepmothers who mistreat them.

Others, she said, include a number of rehabilitation centres and social workers in the cities to attend to their problems and conditions, including sickness.

Every year on April 12, International Day for Street Children provides a voice for children that live on the street so their rights cannot be ignored. The day provides opportunities for human rights organisations to spread awareness for the number of street children throughout the world.

According to recent statistics, up to 150 million children throughout the world live on the street, with some living on the street with their families, others spend majority of their time on the street begging for food and money, while others live on the street as orphans with no family or no home to return to at night.

In 1989, the United Nations held the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which highlighted some of the rights that all children in the world should have, including the right to a stable, loving, and nurturing environment, healthcare and nutrition, clean water and electric power, equal opportunities and to live in dignity and freedom.</text>

    <title>Land row: New twist as residents demand Shs10b from Nyakairima widow</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/land-row-new-twist-as-residents-demand-shs10b-from-nyakairima-s-widow-4202248</url>

    <text>A section of residents in Kiyuni Parish, Gayaza Sub County in Kyankwanzi District who were last year evicted, are demanding Shs10.3b in damages from their purported landlord.

Ms Patricia Alinda Nyakairima, the widow of Gen Aronda Nyakairima, who claims ownership of the three square mile piece of land barred residents from accessing their bibanja (plots of land) saying they are illegal occupants.

Soldiers were also deployed to guard the land stretching across seven villages of Kyerere East, Kiyuni, Birama, Kyakibenje, Butikiro, Dagaza and Kiyuni Central.

Through their lawyers M/s GW Bwanika and Company Advocates, the evictees say if they don‚Äôt get any response from Ms Nyakairima within 14 days, they will go ahead and file a legal suit against her alongside the Uganda People‚Äôs Defense Forces (UPDF).

The evictees claim that between February 28 and March 3, 2022, Ms Nyakairima with the aid and protection of armed UPDF soldiers descended on their villages with eight graders, two excavators, two tractors and started leveling the ground, leaving only the residents homes standing .

‚ÄúOur clients handed over to us all the photographs and recorded videos of illegal activities in protection of the UPDF forces,‚Äù the intention to sue document dated March 24 reads in part

The evictees further claim that the eviction started from the land on Block 710 Plot 19 without first carrying out any boundary opening exercise and went on the land on Block 711 Plot 3 ,then Block 711 Plot 5 and 7 and parts of Block 709 Plot 1.

Ms Nyakairima‚Äôs lawyers of Kob Advocates & Solicitors, Office of Internal Affairs Minister and that of Chief of Defence Forces acknowledged receipt of the evictees‚Äô intention to sue on April 3, 2023.

Mr Bruno Sserunkuma, one of the evictees‚Äô lawyers said: " My team is under instructions to take this matter to Mubende High Court if those people fail to act accordingly," he said in a telephone interview on Sunday.

Mr Innocent Okongo, a lawyer working with Kobs Advocates and Solicitors admitted receiving the evictees‚Äô intention to sue saying his colleagues are yet to meet and discuss it.

Efforts to speak to the UPDF Spokesperson Brig Felix Kulayigye and his deputy Col Deo Akiiki were futile as their known contacts were off.

But Internal Affairs Minister, Gen. Kahinda Otafiire, said the evictees are free to seek legal redress.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drag me into that, let them go [to court] if they feel their rights were violated,‚Äù he said.

Last week, it emerged that Ms Nyakairima had allowed some few affected residents to access their Bibanja and grow some crops.

According to Mr Leosan Ssebalunzi, the Gayaza Sub County chairperson, those currently accessing their gardens are under instructions to use the land only during this planting season and leave after harvesting their crops.

During a meeting with evictees and local leaders on March 2, State minister for Lands, Mr Sam Mayanja, directed more than 300 evictees to return to their ancestral land and prepare for the planting season which started last month .

Mr Mayanja also ordered the Kyankwanzi Resident District Commissioner, Ms Sharon Ankunda, to ensure that whoever was illegally evicted returns. The minister claimed that the family of late Gen Nyakairima gave her wrong information about the disputed land, portraying herself as the sole owner yet there were other landlords.

‚ÄúI, therefore, stand here to declare the cancellation of all land titles the family of Gen Nyakairima holds,‚Äù he said then.

In an earlier interview with this publication Ms Nyakairima stated that her family rightfully acquired the land, adding that she was ready to defend it at all costs.</text>

    <title>District grapples with poor service delivery</title>

    <text>Kitagwenda District is grappling with poor service delivery four years after it was carved out of Kamwenge District.

Local leaders and residents were optimistic that this would improve service delivery .

However, the district faces a number of challenges that have hindered development. These include low revenue collection, poor health services, poor road networks, lack of an administration block and some schools operate in dilapidated structures.

The district chairperson, Mr Ismail Mushemeza, said the district has 280 kilometres of roads which are in a sorry state and yet they lack the equipment to repair them.

Mr Mushemeza said the district budgeted for Shs120 million for the road fund in the last financial year but only received Shs70 million and the majority of the roads were not worked on.

Some of the roads that are in a sorry state include Rwetuha-Mahyoro road, Kichwamba-Ganiko road, Ntaara-Kyabatimba-Katoma road, Ibanda-Mahyoro-Kyabura road and Ibanda-Kabujogera road.

During the rainy season, Kamwenge-Kitagwenda Road is cut off by floods at River Mpanga.

The same road is part of a presidential pledge of 2016 when Kitagwenda district was still part of Kamwenge District.

‚ÄúWe are not regretting why we got a new district but we have several challenges. Now we have Shs70 million on the district account for road fund but we have failed to use it because we don‚Äôt have a road unit. We depend on hiring from other districts,‚Äù he said.

He added that in each financial year, they plan to collect Shs500 million under local revenue but end up collecting between Shs100 million and Shs200 million.





Revenue

Mr Mushemeza said their biggest source of local revenue is Dura Quarry in Kanara Sub-county where limestone is mined. He said the quarry generates Shs200 million annually.

He, however, said they have been battling Kamwenge District over ownership of the quarry since 2019. He added that there is an ongoing case in court regarding the matter.

‚ÄúThe district local revenue is low and four sub-counties depend on 20 percent revenue sharing from Queen Elizabeth National Park of about Shs40 million each, other sub-counties are struggling to conduct six councils [meetings] a year,‚Äù he added.

The district also has no hospital. Ntara Health Centre IV now works as the main health facility in the district. There have been pleas from local leaders to upgrade the facility into a hospital.

‚ÄúThe Ministry of Health told us to first build a theatre, laboratory, mortuary and staff quarters to have Ntara Health Centre IV upgraded to a hospital, our partner Baylor Uganda gave us Shs280 million for the construction of a laboratory, we have a mortuary and we are looking for money to build staff house,‚Äù Mr Mushemeza said.

There are, however, health centre IIIs although Bukurungu Town Council and Kichehce Sub-county don‚Äôt have a health facility.

The district only has one ambulance, which was donated by the district Woman Member of Parliament, Ms Dorothy Nyakato Nzibonera.

Mr Yasin Kezimbira, the youth councillor of Kitagwenda District, said the district needs Shs1.2 billion to complete the construction of the administration block.

Ms Doreen Natukunda, a district councillor who doubles as secretary for production and natural resources, said construction of district headquarters stalled on the second floor.

‚ÄúThe district came with some jobs and our people have been employed. There is also close monitoring of government programmes unlike when we were still under Kamwenge District,‚Äù she said.

Ms Natukunda, however, said the district received funds to construct a staff house at Kanara Health Centre III and construction of Kanara Seed School and a laboratory at Kabujogera Health Centre III are ongoing.

Access to water in the district has also been a challenge. At least 85 percent of the population in the district has access to water. The district has 22 water source points but these have not functioned for more than five years and are considered abandoned.

One of the water point projects worth Shs723.7 million meant to benefit 7,500 people in Kanara Sub-county has been non-functional since its commissioning in October last year.

The Kanara Sub-county chairperson, Mr Francis Hategeka, said residents were optimistic that they would start accessing clean and safe water but unfortunately, people only fetched water on public tap stands for three weeks.

The district has six government-aided secondary schools and 68 primary schools. Many of the schools were constructed in 2002 and are now in a sorry state.

The Tooro region coordinator in the office of national chairperson, Ms Barbra Nabaasa, said it is true that Kitagwenda is still grappling with many challenges but said a report has been compiled to support the office of the president for action.

‚ÄúKitagwenda is among the new districts with many challenges like in the health sector and education, we have compiled a report with all issues that need urgent action and they have been given to the Office of President,‚Äù she said.





govt response

The State minister for Local Government, Ms Victoria Businge Rusoke, said all the newly created districts were given startup funds.

She said they will be given more funding, saying the government is currently in the process of budgeting and that the government is aware of their challenges.</text>

    <title>State House officials storm Bugisu after Monitor story</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/state-house-officials-storm-bugisu-after-monitor-story-4202148</url>

    <date>2023-04-17 10:08:56+00:00</date>
    <text>The State House Health Monitoring officials have camped in Namisindwa District to investigate, among others, allegations of absenteeism of health workers at various health centres.

This comes a week after the Monitor story indicated that watchmen were operating health centres, especially in the rural districts of Bugisu sub-region, because of absenteeism.

The investigation unearthed the pain expectant mothers go through when they check into some of the health facilities at night and they are assisted by the watchmen to deliver.

The story also indicated that health workers rarely work on weekends and on public holidays in some of the health centres.

For instance, around 1pm on Good Friday patients were stranded with no health worker to attend to them at Bupoto Health Centre III. The facility is about 300 metres from the district headquarters.

The head of State House Health Monitoring Unit, Dr Warren Namara, confirmed at the weekend that some officials from the unit are in Namisindwa. But he declined to divulge details.

However, the Resident District Commissioner (RDC) of Namisindwa, Hajj Imran Muluga, told the Monitor on Saturday that State House officials are in the district following the publication‚Äôs story.

‚ÄúThe State House team is moving around the facilities to see whether the health centres are working. We are not moving with them. They are doing their job,‚Äù Hajji Muluga said.

Mr Emma Bwayo, the Namisindwa District youth councillor, said the State House officials‚Äô visit is timely.

‚ÄúThe unit shouldn‚Äôt wait for news before embarking on their mandated routine visits. I hope they (State House Health Monitioring Unit) keep visiting health facilities,‚Äù Mr Bwayo said.

He also said there is a need to strengthen the supervision of health centres in the district in order to improve service delivery.

Ms Juliet Kakai, a retired teacher, commended the Monitor for unearthing the rot in the health centres, saying it has been a big challenge.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to get treatment at night and on weekends in our health facilities. Something should be done to save our lives,‚Äù Ms Kakai said.

However, the in-charge at Bupoto Health Centre III, Ms Suzan Mukimba, dismissed allegations of absenteeism, saying the facility is understaffed.

‚ÄúWe work 24 hours and we have one midwife who sleeps around the facility to handle emergencies,‚Äù Ms Mukimba said, adding that Health Centre IIIs don‚Äôt admit patients but they refer them to Health Centre IVs.

The Namisindwa deputy RDC, Ms Juliet Solome Namara, said: ‚ÄúSome health workers have conditioned the patients that there is no working after lunch and on weekends. This is a practice that must be stopped because health workers are well paid to work as expected.‚Äù

Recently, Ms Namara, with security officers, made an impromptu visit from 11pm-2am to some health centre IIIs, including Bupoto, Bubutu, Bumbo and Bumwoni and they did not find any staff.

The Namisindwa District Health officer, Dr Steven Masai Wasu, said some health workers tend to run away because they don‚Äôt have accommodation at the facilities.

It‚Äôs a mistake to send away the patients. Such health workers need to be punished,‚Äù Dr Masai said.

However, Mr Abdullah Magambo, the deputy speaker for Mbale City, said district health officers are not doing enough.</text>

    <title>Alupo assures on govt plan to transform education</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/alupo-assures-on-govt-plan-to-transform-education-4202214</url>

    <date>2023-04-17 10:34:40+00:00</date>
    <text>Vice President Jesca Alupo has said the government‚Äôs plan of skilling learners at different education levels is aimed at fighting unemployment in the country.

According to Ms Alupo, the government‚Äôs effort to mainstream skills development under the Ministry of Education and Sports is to facilitate the achievement of the strategic development goals.

‚ÄúSome of the key reforms include pursuing a deliberate policy of promoting science, technology and mathematics, implementation of the revised lower secondary school curriculum, which is competence-based, and implementation of the digital agenda, among others,‚Äù she said.

This was contained in her speech read by the State Minister for Higher Education Dr John Chrysestom Muyingo at the golden jubilee celebrations for Ndejje Secondary School in Luweero District at the weekend.

‚ÄúThe fact that Ndejje SS is offering vocational skills such as computing, talent development on top of the regular academic studies in line with the government‚Äôs effort in skilling the youth, re-echoes the many other strategies aimed at equipping our children with employable skills,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúA newly formulated project is in its advanced stage with a component to revamp our traditional schools. Ndejje SS has been identified as one of the first beneficiaries of this very important project,‚Äù she added.

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Ms Ketty Lamaro, re-echoed the government strategy of continuous professional development of teachers.

‚ÄúWe are also aware that the country cannot move without fostering spiritual growth among our learners. We should pay more attention to spiritual aspects to help the youth preserve our values and cultures in an environment that is now very permissive. The fact that Ndejje SS has a vibrant chaplaincy is very encouraging,‚Äù she said.

Retired Bishop of Namirembe Diocese Samuel Balagadde Ssekadde advised parents and teachers to jealously guard against foreign cultures that demean the true purpose of Gods‚Äô love for mankind. Ndejje Secondary School, according to the head teacher, Canon Dr Charles Kahigiriza, started out of the need to extend secondary education to learners from Bulemeezi and Buruli counties in Greater Luweero in 1963.

The school was later taken over by the government in 1965 through the intervention of then Minister for Education Luyimbazi Zaake.</text>

    <title>Lango Saccos stuck with Shs19b Parish Model cash</title>

    <date>2023-04-17 10:32:11+00:00</date>
    <text>A total of 582 of Savings and Credit Cooperative Organisations (Saccos) across Lango sub-region are expected to share Shs19.06 billion under the Parish Development Model (PDM) in the first phase of the programme.

However, the would-be beneficiaries cannot access the money because of the change in guidelines on individual member access, according to a survey conducted by this newspaper early this month.

Mr Ceasar Obadah, the programme coordinator in the office of the National Chairman of National Resistance Movement (NRM), confirmed that each Sacco in Lango got Shs32.7 million.

The Monitor has established that at least 54 PDM Saccos in Lira have been approved for funding. The others are Alebtong [69], Kole [49], Apac [33], Amolatar [83], Dokolo [53], Otuke [51], Oyam [72], Kwania [49], Lira City [49] and Apac Municipality [20].

However, since the guidelines now require that the money be accessed by an individual member not as a group, the funds will now be channelled directly to Sacco members.

As a result, this has affected the smooth implementation of the government‚Äôs ambitious pro-poor development programme.

Mr John Omodo, the chairperson of Chegere Parish PDM Sacco in Chegere Sub-county, Apac District, is not happy about the slow progress in the implementation of the programme.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand whether we really have money in our bank account though leaders in the district have assured us the money is there,‚Äù he said.

Bardek-Atik Parish Sacco in Atik Division, Apac Municipality with 37 enterprise groups, has already received Shs32 million in their bank account.

Mr Alfred Alok, the Sacco chairperson, said 10 members have already been selected to benefit from the fund in the first phase.

‚ÄúMembers were told to open their personal bank accounts and it‚Äôs now time for buying seeds but they are unable to access the fund,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúMany people are now discouraged because of the delay in disbursing the funds to their personal bank accounts,‚Äù he added.

The Apac Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Mr George Abudul, said Apac Municipal Council has already finalised the preparation of groups and has already submitted the list of beneficiaries for funding.

‚ÄúSo, any time we are going to launch the disbursement of funds to the individuals who will be the first beneficiaries. However, Apac District still has some procedures to complete before the money is channelled to the beneficiaries,‚Äù he said.

Ms Susan Adongo, a member of Nyeko Pe Lonyi‚Äô at Tekulu Cell, lpito-Aweno Ward, said their Sacco leaders made them fill a 21-page form and their application was approved but they had not yet received the money.

‚Äúdfcu Bank officials even opened for us bank accounts in mid-March but up to now we have not received any money in our bank accounts,‚Äù Ms Adongo said.

Mr Andrew Ocen of Otimi Ikom Wa Sacco in Kakoge ‚ÄúB‚Äù Cell in Lira City West Division, said they were told during a recent meeting for the selected beneficiary groups that leaders of their groups are the ones who are supposed to receive the money.

‚ÄúWe were told that Shs1 million would be credited into our leaders bank accounts which was opened at dfcu, then they withdraw and give it out to our group members in form of a loan but they keep telling us that they have not yet got the money,‚Äù Mr Ocen said.

BACKGROUND

PDM aims at moving households still trapped in the subsistence economy to the money economy by emphasising agricultural value-chain development to increase commercial production.</text>

    <text>President Museveni has directed Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja to ensure that the late permanent secretary in her office, Keith Muhakanizi is accorded an official burial.

In an April 15 letter, Ms Nabbanja said the late Muhakanizi deserves an official send-off in honour of the distinguished he rendered to the country.

‚ÄúH.E The President has directed that Keith Muhakanizi be accorded an official burial in honour of his great contribution to the country,‚Äù reads in part the press statement authored by Ms Nabbanja.

The premier‚Äôs statement further indicated that the permanent secretary in the office of the President, Hajj Yunus Kakande, has been appointed to chair the national organising committee for the burial of Muhakanizi.

Muhakanizi passed on last Thursday in Milan, Italy, where he had been flown for specialised treatment.

A state burial is provided in law for specified public officers while an official funeral is granted by the President to any person for, among others, their exceptional contribution to the country.

The government meets all the funeral expenses if one is accorded an official send-off.

A distinguished economist, Muhakanizi cut his teeth in the civil service world when he was the Finance ministry‚Äôs permanent secretary who also doubled as the secretary to the treasury for close to a decade.

The Prime Minister described him as a hardworking, intelligent, sincere, and result-oriented civil servant.

‚ÄúMuhakanizi was a celebrated economist and permanent secretary who made a significant contribution to the development of our country by championing robust public sector reforms and offering sound advice,‚Äù Ms Nabbanja said.

By press time last evening, the burial programme had not been released, but Ms Nabbanja had indicated it would be released in due course.

    <title>Women entrepreneurs to tap into Shs200b fund at Expo</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/women-entrepreneurs-to-tap-into-shs200b-fund-at-expo-4202002</url>

    <date>2023-04-17 08:25:56+00:00</date>
    <text>Despite Uganda being the leading country in Africa with the highest number of women-owned enterprises, according to the Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs report, there is hardly growth and progress of the majority of these businesses.

The business, most of which are micro and small, fail to grow due to a lack of tailor-made financing, compliance, regulatory burden, limited book keeping, and financial literacy.

Further, the informal nature of operations continues to derail the growth of enterprises across the country, with women‚Äôs businesses bearing the heaviest brunt.

The covid-19 pandemic and its subsequent effects also didn‚Äôt spare micro and small businesses, the majority of which are women-owned enterprises, according to the 2021 Economic Policy Research Centre survey.

In an effort to support the entrepreneurial journey of women in Uganda, particularly those involved in micro and small enterprises, the Archdiocese of Mbarara Development Association (AMDA) will engage economic sector players across the board, including ministries, departments, and agencies of government in an expo scheduled for early next month.

In the expo, whose theme focuses on leveraging technology while embracing environmentally friendly ways of doing business, women entrepreneurs will be exposed to Shs200 billion in funds to revive or recapitalise their enterprises.

While announcing the expo, in collaboration with the Federation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises - Uganda (FSME) at the weekend in Kampala, the AMDA Council Chairperson, Ms Spera Atuhairwe, said financiers across the board will be available to engage with women-owned businesses.

The Executive Director of FSME, Mr John Walugembe, said women whose businesses were affected by covid-19 will have the opportunity to apply for the Shs200 billion funds meant to rescue small enterprises.

The government has since provided Shs100 billion while the participating financial institutions put together another Shs100 billion, making it a Shs200 billion revolving fund for small and micro entrepreneurs.

The uptake of these monies has been painstakingly slow, according to the Bank of Uganda, which is the overseer of the fund.

FSME has since been drawn in to help with the deepening of uptake, which explains the expo and collaboration between the two ‚Äì AMDA and FSME, which is the first of its kind.

‚ÄúThere is so much inhibiting the growth of businesses, and for women, the challenges are even much deeper,‚Äù said Ms Atuhairwe.

She added: ‚ÄúOur people don‚Äôt understand tax issues, they do not know how to go about the process of formal business registration and they rarely have networks to learn from. The expo will resolve all these problems, including having successful and experienced entrepreneurs share their knowledge.‚Äù

The AMDA Women Council Vice Chairperson, Ms Agatha Ayebazibwe, said profiling of business according to the sector, products and appeal will also be on the menu as one way to enhance women-owned businesses across the country.</text>

    <text>The Kibuli Muslim faction has hailed the Aga Khan for funding the construction of the Kibuli Mosque, which has in turn produced institutions such as Kibuli hospital, schools and other social services.

They said this yesterday while receiving donations of food and clothing from the Esmaili Community.

‚ÄúEvery time you come here, we receive you with a lot of honour and gratitude because of the foundation the Aga Khan planted here. Badru Kakungulu donated 80 acres of land for construction of institutions, which would later benefit many Ugandans,‚Äù he said.

Ms Jasmin Halani, the country leader of Esmaili Community, said wherever the Esmaili Community lives around the world, they do not believe in racial segregation but brotherhood.

She added that it is the reason they organise programmes to show communities what they do. Lately, they have been involved in environmental campaigns such as tree planting, food donations and health campaigns.

Mr Azhar Bandali, the chairman of Outreach Council Uganda, said as a community, they teach children from childhood the importance of community service and helping people around them.

He added that the food donation is one of the activities they have undertaken this year.</text>

    <title>Samia takes on Tanzania graft cartels</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/samia-takes-on-tanzania-graft-cartels-4201816</url>

    <date>2023-04-17 02:27:55+00:00</date>
    <text>In November 2021 at the Dubai Airshow, Tanzania placed an order for a Boeing 767-300 freighter, besides a 787-8 Dreamliner and two 737 MAXs. The freighter would be used to capitalise on Africa‚Äôs burgeoning cargo demand, Boeing and the Air Tanzania Company said.

‚ÄúThe 767 freighter will give Air Tanzania exceptional capability and flexibility to meet passenger and cargo demand within Africa and beyond,‚Äù said Air Tanzania chief executive Ladislaus Matindi.

And now, as national carrier prepares to receive Africa‚Äôs first B767-300F, a mix of excitement and anxiety is palpable in Dar es Salaam. Last month, plane spotters saw the aircraft conducting test flights at the Boeing Factory at Paine Field, Seattle. It was expected at the Julius Nyerere International Airport on March 31, but the delivery was delayed by ‚Äúsupplier issues‚Äù.

Immediate sacking

Boeing said ‚Äúquality issues‚Äù forced it to rework the 767Fs and the delivery is expected this month.

But in Dar, President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been fuming over the purchase of this plane, which was billed to turn Dar into a cargo hub in the region. The newest report of the Controller and Auditor-General (CAG) has uncovered massive overpricing, after an $86 million invoice was submitted to the government as the final instalment.

This is well over double the $37 million figure in the original purchase contract agreed with the plane manufacturer in Washington D.C.

Irked by the revelations amid a growing public outcry, on April 9, President Samia sacked John Nzulule, director-general of the Tanzania Government Flight Agency, which was charged with handling Air Tanzania‚Äôs plane purchases under the John Magufuli-initiated revival strategy.

Dissolved railways board

The President also dissolved the Tanzania Railways Corporation board, after the CAG findings showed that the public agency twice rejected tenders to purchase locomotives and passenger coaches for the new standard gauge railway (SGR) at the lowest bid price of $263.4 million, in favour of a $478 million offer, costing the government about $215 million more.

The rot in the two corporations is just an example of a web of corruption in the Tanzanian government and quasi-government institutions flagged by the CAG Charles Kichere.

The revelations in Mr Kichere‚Äôs audit for the 2021/2022 fiscal year, which was made public on April 7, put the spotlight on the President, who has been endeavouring to clean up the public sector and the country‚Äôs image as an investment destination in Africa, devoid of red tape and graft.

Campaign for re-election

They also potentially dent her campaign for re-election in the next cycle of polls.

Mr Kichere‚Äôs report unveils serious misuse and embezzlement of funds in flagship government projects dating from the era of Samia‚Äôs predecessor John Magufuli, but this time also implicating her own administration in no small measure.

Firebrand opposition leader Tundu Lissu of the Chadema party has put the estimated loss of public funds due to graft, mismanagement and negligence at Tsh2 trillion ($862 million).

Major projects such as the standard gauge railway, the Nyerere Hydropower Dam and the Air Tanzania revival programme have been flagged for serious impropriety while virtually all the key public utilities are under scrutiny for irregular expenditure.

The usual suspects

Backed by President Samia‚Äôs call for more transparency in government spending, the annual CAG audit for the first time included projects that were previously exempt from audit by the Magufuli administration. One is the Air Tanzania‚Äôs plane purchases.

Although CAG Kichere issued unqualified opinions indicating satisfactory financial reporting and record-keeping by 96 percent of the 1,045 government agencies audited in 2021/2022, his report details endemic financial irregularities and loss-making trends in most of them.

The spotlighted entities included the Tanzania Telecommunications Corporation, Tanzania Electric Supply Company, Medical Stores Department, Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania National Parks Authority, Rural Energy Agency and the National Health Insurance Fund.

Pension funds National Social Security Fund (NSSF) and Public Service Social Security Fund were found to be struggling with fast declining occupancy rates in their Dar es Salaam real estate investments, partly due to a steady exodus of big business clients to the administrative capital Dodoma.

Poor business decisions

A total of 45 public entities were cited for making losses for two consecutive years, 14 of them being commercial firms that are supposed to be reporting profits instead of losing money.

Top on the new list of shame is the national carrier, Air Tanzania, despite cutting its losses minimally from Tsh36.18 billion ($15.6 million) to Tsh35.2 billion ($15.17 million).

Tanzania Railways Corporation posted a much higher deficit ‚Äî Tsh31.29 billion ($13.5 million) in 2022 ‚Äî against Tsh22.8 billion ($9.83 million) in 2021.

The National Development Corporation cut its losses by over half, from Tsh26.3 billion ($11.33 million) in 2021 to Tsh11.9 billion ($5.13 million), but remained on the critical list.

State-owned TIB Development Bank recorded a Tsh838 million ($361,200) loss in 2022, against Tsh292.3 million ($125,990) in 2021, which was blamed on an increase in non-performing loans to 20.3 percent, well above the central bank‚Äôs 5 percent threshold. It is instructive to state that most of the bank‚Äôs clients are government institutions.

Among non-commercial firms, the NHIF led in the loss-making zone, with its losses shooting up almost twofold from Tsh109.7 billion ($47.28 million) to Tsh204.6 billion ($88.2 million) in just two years.

According to Mr Kichere, most of the listed non-commercial public entities suffered as a consequence of ‚Äúhaving no access to government subsidies or alternative sources of income,‚Äù while those in the commercial category were guilty of ‚Äúpoor business decisions, poor supervision of investments, and poor financial management.‚Äù

The collusion

The report says that many government institutions have failed to meet their own performance targets in line with strategic plans, undermining their ability and capacity to compete with private sector rivals. Weaknesses were also detected in revenue collection and recording in 180 local government authorities, with more than Tsh91 billion ($39.22 million) going down the drain.

The audit also brought to light that government officials were colluding with some international private companies to perpetrate the graft and rot within government, as in the invoice matter involving aircraft maker Boeing.

Standard Chartered Bank has also been criticised over the conditions that it set for a $1.46 billion loan to facilitate the SGR project, which ultimately raised the cost by several million dollars.

Single-sourcing trap

According to the report, the bank named Turkish firm Yapi Merkezi as the only acceptable contractor for at least two phases of the project. The company was eventually awarded the construction job via a single-source tender arrangement, in spite of Tanzania‚Äôs procurement rules that stipulate competitive bidding for such contracts.

Under the Yapi Merkezi contract, the Tanzanian government is obliged to pay between $5.2 million and $5.5 million for each rail kilometre built over a 790-kilometre stretch, while other phases of the planned 1,800-km line, which were subjected to a competitive bidding process, are costing from $3.9 million to $4.6 million per kilometre.

In its 2022 report on operations in Tanzania, Standard Chartered Bank described its SGR loan as the ‚Äúlargest syndicated transaction in sub-Saharan Africa outside the oil and gas sector to date (which has) positively changed the accepted norms on how such deals are structured and how risks are managed effectively.‚Äù

Hydropower project

The Nyerere hydropower project in southern Tanzania was also flagged for delayed payment of Tsh327.9 billion ($141.33 million) in assorted levies to hasten its completion.

President Samia has instructed Chief Secretary Moses Kailua to supervise ‚Äúlegal action‚Äù against public officials implicated in the widespread financial accounting flaws spelt out in the audit.

Public expectations are that the President‚Äôs move marks the beginning of a bigger crackdown on government corruption under her government and more heads will roll.

Uncontrollable factors

But the president continues to face pressure to do much more towards curbing graft within her administration, with main opposition parties Chadema and ACT Wazalendo predictably using the CAG report‚Äôs findings as fresh fuel to further drum up public apathy towards Samia‚Äôs ruling CCM party.

ACT Wazalendo leader Zitto Kabwe described the report‚Äôs findings as ‚Äúthe same old story‚Äù of poor governance under CCM, quoting the report‚Äôs observation that only 36 percent of the 6,947 recommendations contained in the 2020/2021 audit were implemented.

Chadema secretary-general John Mnyika said the public outcry triggered by the report‚Äôs revelations was not likely to cool down as quickly as in previous years because of a soaring cost of living caused in part by some uncontrollable factors such as the Ukraine war, drought and the impact of Covid.

According to Mr Mnyika, ensuring financial discipline in governance should be ‚Äúa top priority at this time of economic difficulties for everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdding up all the dirt mentioned by the Controller and Auditor-General this year, more than Tsh2 trillion have been lost,‚Äù Mr Lissu is quoted by the Citizen newspaper as saying. ‚ÄúThis is happening in a country whose people are facing many problems.‚Äù

    <title>Kabale, Leeds varsities partner to offer free surgical services</title>

    <text>The Surgical Department of Kabale University School of Medicine with support from Leeds University in the United Kingdom and the Rural Surgery Innovations Organisation in India have partnered to offer free specialised surgical services in Kigezi Sub-region.

The Gasless Laparoscopic Surgery services were launched last week at Kabale Regional Referral Hospital after Leeds University donated equipment worth ¬£2,000 (about Shs9.2 million) while Kabale University provided doctors from its surgical department.

The head of the Surgical Department at Kabale University School of Medicine, Dr Robert Mugarura, is leading the institution‚Äôs doctors while Dr Gnanaraj Jesudian is in charge of the international doctors.

‚ÄúThe Gasless Laparoscopic Surgery free services were launched at Kabale Hospital main theater on Tuesday [last week] and 18 patients were lined up to benefit from this arrangement. The Surgical Department of Kabale University is providing human resources, Kabale Regional Referral Hospital providing the working space, while Leeds University and the Rural Surgery Innovations Organisation in India are providing equipment and expertise. This surgical camp is expected to end on April 22. The trained Ugandan doctors shall continue offering free gasless laparoscopic surgeries to the people in Kigezi Sub-region,‚Äù Dr Robert Mugarura said.

He added that although the Gasless Laparoscopic Surgery is expensive on the open market, the financial and equipment support will sustain free services to the local population.

Patients that require the Gasless Laparoscopic Surgery include those with fertility problems, unexplained abdominal pains, appendix, and gallbladder stones.

‚ÄúGasless Laparoscopic Surgery is 10 times more expensive compared to the local open surgeries because of the equipment and the expertise required. We are grateful to our partners because this offer will serve our local population well since the wounds under this arrangement take about one week to heal unlike the traditional medical surgeries that take about six weeks. Other advantages of Gasless Laparoscopic Surgery include minimal scars, no big surgery wounds, early return to normal activities and discharge from hospitals,‚Äù Dr Mugarura said.

Dr Jesudian said the donated equipment can last for about 15 years, depending on the care given to it.

‚ÄúThe techniques to use the Gasless Laparoscopic Surgery equipment are easy to learn and the process is safe for patients. We shall continue to support the surgical department of Kabale University School of Medicine and Kabale Regional Referral Hospital to ensure that these services remain free to patients,‚Äù Dr Gnanaraj said.

A 34-year-old woman, whose fallopian tubes were operated during the Gasless Laparoscopic Surgery health camp at Kabale Hospital, said she was feeling okay just a day after the operation.

‚ÄúI feel I should be discharged because I am not feeling any pain. The surgery was successful and I was told by the doctors that my fallopian tubes were blocked for 5-years because of an infection I had. I hope after the opening of these tubes, I will be able to conceive because I have never had a child despite being married for seven year,‚Äù the patient, who preferred to speak on condition of anonymity, said.

The director of Kabale Regional Referral Hospital, Dr Filbert Nyeko, welcomed the support.

‚ÄúI welcome this development although I am waiting to be informed about the sustainability of this programme in this facility,‚Äù Dr Nyeko said.</text>

    <title>Shock as 99-year-old woman commits suicide in Namutumba</title>

    <text>Police in Busoga East are investigating circumstances under which 99-year-old Kizile Buladina, a resident of Kimanyilo Village, in Ivukula Sub County, Namutumba District committed suicide by hanging.

Buladina reportedly used a waist band which she anchored around her neck and onto a rafter inside her house.

Buladina's lifeless body was found by a neighbour who got concerned after not seeing her sitting outside the house as her daily routine for a couple of years.

Mr Mulondo Balikudembe, a resident in the area says that Bulandina lost all her relatives and was being taken care of by well-wishers in the community, who collectively ensured her access to meals and other necessities on a daily basis.

Mr Balikudembe said the deceased seemed happy and exchanged pleasant smiles with whoever paid her courtesy visits, making it hard for them to suspect that she was going through any difficulty which might have pushed her to committing suicide.

Ms Slyvia Tebigwayo, a women councilor in Ivukula Sub County said Buladina has been an open minded elder, who offered counsel to both the old and the young alike with satirical briefs from the ancient times, which attracted many to her house all day long. She adds that no matter what has transpired, the residents have unanimously agreed to accord Buladina a decent burial, in memory of her legacy to their community.

Ms Tebigwayo further implored all people to seek counsel from religious leaders, friends or elders whenever they encounter life challenges, as a way of reducing depression, domestic violence and acts of suicide.

The Busoga East police spokesperson, Diana Nandawula, said the autopsy procedures would be conducted at Ivukula health center III mortuary and the body would be be handed over to the community for burial.

    <title>If highly-educated people can‚Äôt be supervised, who should be?</title>

    <text>My prayers are with the Office of the Prime Minister family on the loss of their Permanent Secretary Keith Muhakanizi. He sometimes made public service admirable, even for those outside of it. That generation of public servants, knowledgeable and firm, is getting rare.

Talking of public service, it is hard to know what is going on. [Prime Minister] Robinah Nabbanja has been widely quoted, wondering how she is expected to supervise a woman who is highly educated like Mary Goretti Kitutu [Karamoja Affairs minister] . She confesses to not knowing what Kitutu is ‚Äòdoctor of‚Äô but that, she knows she is a doctor.

And who can blame her, in a world where too many people walk around claiming they are ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô of this or that. It can be confusing. One day I left my work ID at one of the ministry gates. When I returned, the guard asked that she wanted to consult me on something. We stepped aside, then she said, ‚Äòdoctor, I have been having this recurrent pain in my‚Ä¶‚Äô I felt bad, and gently told her I was a masquerading doctor. And gave her something small to see a real doctor.

When we were younger, we were told, ‚Äòyour work must speak for you‚Äô, and that you could not possibly walk around telling people how good you are, how much brilliance resides above your shoulders. I knew people, who looked dull and uninteresting, even uninspiring, until you saw what they were doing or heard of their accomplishments, then you would be in awe, giving real respect.

Not even the real doctors, walked around saying, ‚ÄòI am doctor so and so‚Äô. The world has changed, a lot. The little girl you supervised yesterday may very easily become your boss tomorrow.

In a training for leaders, I attended recently, the facilitator was unrelenting in her plea to supervisors, ‚Äòdo not confuse confidence for competence‚Äô. She kept repeating that the notion of a confident person as a competent one, can be problematic for those in leadership and in making hiring decisions. Once hired, they are not what they seemed. It reminded me of the old saying, ‚Äòdo not judge a book by the cover‚Äô.

Someone told me the other day, in response to my article last week about the framing of women leaders, that it is important to refrain from framing women as incorruptible or good leaders because of their nurture. What if we simply treated women as human beings? Or to treat it as Hillary Clinton put it, that women‚Äôs rights are just human rights in the end.

Combo: Karamoja Affairs minister Mary Goretti Kitutu and Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja

Never put people in the same box just because they share identity. Even women have varied interests, including those in the same political party. So naturally, women politicians, will have variety of interests. You can never bulk women, because they belong to the same political party, have attained a certain level of education or are rural, and assume that they are all the same.

The truth is, you cannot generalise human beings, based on some identity markers, which most times, are laden with value judgments. For instance, not all men beat women, not all men sexually harass women at work, not all husbands provide for women, not all working women do not support their husbands, and so on and so forth. The biggest problem, is to judge human beings on the basis of their achievements.

If education, or lack of it, was the true measure of man or of integrity, then all the people stealing from the government, the sick and their partners, would not be occupying so much of our discussion. Look at how much length the government has gone to, if the account of President Museveni is to go by, to just fight corruption, with little success. Then there are the land issues and well-dressed fraudsters working in great institutions of government and private sector.

Even with all the evidence that it is not uneducated people in offices involved in corruption, the good minister still imagines and assumes, that educational attainment implies no supervision. It cannot apply even in relationships, that just because you have met a good-looking man or woman, who is a doctor of something, you assume they are a decent human being. You have to account for poor parenting or lack of it, environment, family background and general lack of common sense or good manners.

In the world of work, supervision is not necessarily because you do not trust people or they have less education, it is part of work culture and process. If part of your job description is to supervise and you cannot do so, you have failed everyone involved. These are challenging times for leaders, they have to rise to the occasion, all the time.</text>

    <title>Iron sheets saga: How to achieve forgiveness</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/oped/commentary/iron-sheets-saga-how-to-achieve-forgiveness-4202192</url>
    <author>[]</author>
    <date>2023-04-17 10:23:01+00:00</date>
    <text>The Daily Monitor on Good Friday carried headlines that were full of biblical allusions to the cross and, by extension, to the theory of satisfactory moral atonement. In my Catholic lessons, ‚Äúsatisfactory moral atonement‚Äù holds that Jesus Christ redeemed humanity through making satisfaction for humankind‚Äôs disobedience through his own ‚Äúsupererogatory obedience on the cross.‚Äù

The theological teachings behind this theory are in tandem with the legal concept in our constitution of balancing out an injustice whist keeping in mind that one of God‚Äôs chief characteristics is justice, and accordingly, any upsets to that justice must always be atoned for.

As such, while the cartoons depicting Karamoja Affairs minister Dr Mary Goretti Kitutu as a sacrificial lamb were meant to allude to the theory of atonement at exactly the time that Christians were reflecting on why Jesus died on the cross for them, it didn‚Äôt go down well with most people.

Most Christians felt it was heretical to present a frail human, who seemed already overwhelmed by her thoughtless acts of involving her entire family along with 22 ministers and about 33 Members of Parliament (MPs) in an unforgivable web of insensitivity.

What is even more disturbing is that the Karamoja iron sheets were shared in Kampala, a place where you commonly hear the mindless statement, ‚ÄúWe shall not wait for Karamoja to develop,‚Äù being thrown around carelessly.

Clearly, singling out Dr Kitutu to go through the shameful trials at the Chief Magistrate‚Äôs chambers, does not amount to satisfactory moral atonement for the avarice surrounding the gross mismanagement of relief items and other development programmes meant for Karamoja and other disadvantaged regions in Uganda.

And, as we ‚Äòwaste time‚Äô waiting for the outcomes of the Anti-Corruption Court proceedings and Parliament‚Äôs committee report on this matter, it is important to remember that the Karamoja valley dams‚Äô saga and the subsequent investigations amounted to nothing. Dr Speciosa Kazibwe [former vice president of Uganda] was let off scot-free, and yet the Karimojong have continued to be a nuisance in most parts of Teso Sub-region in their incessant search for water for their livestock.

So, what would count as satisfactory moral atonement and lead to complete forgiveness from the Ateker people of Karamoja and Teso from the transgressions from these ministers who have been consumed by greed and hubris? The solution is simple and one which is in line with the Ateker people‚Äôs cultural climate.

Carlson et al (2012) in a study funded by the Irish Aid, observed that the spiritual component of the Karimojong customary law fuses the judicial, political and social elements of daily life. To that end, each member within a community has roles aimed at maintaining social organisation and to uphold the cultural norms and values. This cultural framework gives authority to elders to enforce discipline upon members of their communities with the aim of ‚Äúpunishing perpetrators of violence or reforming degenerative behaviour.‚Äù

Therefore, if the NRM government wishes to seek amends for the stolen iron sheets and other cynical acts of commission and omissions against the people in that sub-region, the elders demand two things.</text>

    <title>Graft: A malignant cancer biting through to the future</title>

    <text>Corruption continues to present as a malignant cancer in Uganda today, with reports indicating a chronic deterioration in regard to the cost it creates in society development.

In the first quarter of 2023, Uganda has grappled with unresolved corruption cases from the National Social Security Fund saga to Parish Development Model (PDM) cash saga, to Entebbe Airport extortion videos and testimonies as well as the on-going iron sheets scandal in the Office of the Prime Minister.

According to the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2022 published by Transparency International, Uganda scored 27 of 100, indicating a high level of perceived corruption. This placed Uganda at 142nd out of 180 countries and territories included in the index.

In the recent years, there have been several high-profile corruption scandals in Uganda, including allegations of corruption in the procurement of medical supplies during the Covid-19 pandemic, embezzlement of public funds, and mismanagement of public resources with no apparent prosecution of the perpetrators.

It is important to note that corruption is a complex and multifaceted issue, and measuring its extent and impact can be challenging. While statistics and indices provide a useful indicator, they may not capture the full extent of corruption and its impact on society.

Corruption is a significant challenge in Uganda, with detrimental impacts on various sectors of society. The recently published report by the African Union titled: ‚ÄúStolen Futures: The Impact of Corruption on Children in Africa‚Äù highlights the impact of corruption on children in Africa, including in Uganda.

The report notes that corruption in Uganda has a particularly significant impact on children‚Äôs access to education. In the education sector, it has led to lack of resources and low quality education, particularly in rural areas.



The impact of corruption on children‚Äôs access to healthcare in Uganda has led to lack of resources and poor quality healthcare. Children are, therefore, unable to access essential healthcare services, such as vaccinations. And consequently, Uganda continues to lose its young people to preventable diseases and rugged service delivery systems.

The government must prioritise investment in education and ensure that all children have access to quality education. This includes investing in infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and teacher training, to improve the quality of education.

Additionally, the government should promote transparency in the education sector and hold those responsible for corruption accountable. We can no longer go from one corruption scandal to another with no one being held accountable for stealing taxpayers‚Äô hard-earned money and taxes. Someone must pay the hefty price of stealing from an already struggling economy.

The government must prioritise investment in healthcare and ensure that all children have access to quality healthcare services. This includes investing in infrastructure, such as hospitals and clinics, and promoting transparency in the healthcare sector to hold those responsible for corruption accountable.

Additionally, government also needs to strengthen international cooperation and coordination to combat corruption. This includes working with international organisations and other countries to share best practices and coordinate efforts to combat corruption.

In conclusion, the urgent need to address corruption in Uganda should be premised on delivering a better future for our children.</text>

    <title>Makerere guild polls need major surgery</title>

    <text>Universities have always been the biggest breeding ground for the next leaders for many political parties and countries.

At university, the phrase ‚Äòyou are the leaders of tomorrow‚Äô starts to come to life.

Students coming out of the restrictive nature of secondary school start to enjoy their newfound freedom and get a chance to explore.

This freedom is espoused in many ways. From class attendance to sleeping time to budgeting, meals et al, everyone takes their own path.

Many can argue that the Ugandan education system should enable learners to start these processes earlier.

Among the things some look forward to the most at university is an opportunity to get involved in politics.

At 18, you can stand for any elective position including Member of Parliament and the Presidency.

The precedents are there for all to reminisce. The ruling party (NRM) fronted Proscovia Alengot Oromait for Member of Parliament (MP) for Usuk County, Katakwi District in the 2012 by-election.



Following the death of her father, Alengot, then aged 19, became the youngest Member of Parliament in Uganda, and on the African continent.

While her contribution to the August House is not inked in the annals of history, her election totally disregarded age.

Every party in Uganda, big or small, structured or not, has a youth wing which they use to groom the next leaders or appeal to that particular cluster.

This is where mobilisation skills are honed.

So, when Uganda‚Äôs oldest university came up with draconian ruling disqualifying candidates in the 89th guild elections last week, they missed the crystal ball.

They went further to eliminate Ms Margaret Nattabi who was backed by the National Unity Platform (NUP).

The winner, Mr Robert Maseruka, is a third-year student of Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Journalism and Communication after beating eight other contestants.

Maseruka, a former speaker of Nsibirwa hall was endorsed as a NUP candidate at the last hour.</text>

    <title>Uganda and the cost of prejudice</title>

    <text>‚Äú In tackling moral inaptitude and seeming decadency in allocation of resources, the country needs people of courage.

Uganda loses between 2 and 3 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to structural and institutional discrimination, according to a Study by Ministry of Gender and Labour, Economic Policy Research Centre and Civil Society partners.

Quite ambivalent is that, every time discrimination takes place, the status quo is reinforced, spilling a spiral of multiple layers of exclusion.

The youth constitute 70 percent of Uganda‚Äôs population. The majority of them are in the informal sector that constitutes 70 percent of the labour force (Ubos 2022).

The informal sector is barricaded with multiple layers of identities based on challenges of unethical uncompetitive and less productive labour, inaccessibility to capital, limited uptake of technology, inadequate market analytical skills, and a plethora of tax regime that keeps the informal hiding away from opportunities presented by the markets.

Prejudice finds its way from the ‚ÄúWe‚Äù versus ‚ÄúThey‚Äù consciousness as Prof Rukooko [Byaruhanga] of Makerere University once stated in his class of Philosophy and Human Rights. It is the subjective perception that one needs more than others at any cost, including starvation into slavery. This raises a moral question in economics. But economists are not guided by morals, they are guided by forces of demand and supply, they say. Therefore, can we have constructive economics, ready to make amends on the effects of market prejudices? This requires a moral reality check on how services and goods are delivered.

Market imperfections resonate with social economic prejudices that result in biased constructs in our society. That‚Äôs why we need robust social protection mechanisms that will cushion those who may fall through fault lines and those whose time has come to enjoy the fruits of their previous labour. In other words, proper redress measures can mitigate the cost of exclusion and prejudice.

The Equal Opportunities Commission undertook sector audits in gender and equity compliance (2021/2022); the findings clearly take you deep the doldrums of how paperwork equity can be smoothened to portray that our society is moving to a more equal [status]. Despite achievements registered through this innovative compliance assessment of budgets and ministerial policies, a lot still needs to be done to correlate the paperwork findings with physical investments among the vulnerable.

Uganda is not a poor country and this is not contested. The challenge, which should be taken as an opportunity, is how to equitably allocate these resources without prejudice.

There is need for a moral imperative as stated by Jacqueline Novogratz, author of the Manifesto for A Moral Revolution and founder of Acumen Fund that has impacted more than 500 million people. There is also need for inner detachment of personal and subjective innuendos in the delivery of goods and services to the people, with the sole purpose of changing their lives for the better.

That way, we will cut short the cost of prejudice, discrimination and intended and unintended bias. We will see Parish Development Model deliver as a robust affirmative action programme that will enhance economic inclusion. As a country, we will harness our diversity as one of our potential for good.

In tackling moral inaptitude and seeming decadency in allocation of resources, the country needs people of courage. Given the same opportunity, or even affirmative action where necessary, Uganda can unlock the potential lying at the periphery with people with disabilities, women, the youth, the senior citizens, the ethnic, geographical minorities, the poor with out voice, those in informal unregulated sector. These are lost digits in our economy just like the cost and burden of Gender-based violence and boda boda accidents on our economy.</text>

    <title>Anti-gay Bill: Did Parliament overreach its mandate?</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/oped/letters/-anti-gay-bill-did-parliament-overreach-its-mandate--4202428</url>

    <text>The Anti-Homosexuality Bill essentially seeks to prohibit any form of sexual relations between persons of the same sex. This Bill that was recently passed by Parliament awaits presidential assent and perhaps some provisions may be revisited before it is finally made law. The Bill is, at the moment, such a critical piece of legislation in this by and large conservative society that we live in.

Most Ugandans have and may never come to terms with sexual acts involving same-sex persons or broadly speaking sexual relations between LGBTQ+ (lesbians, gay, bisexuals, transgender, queer).

Perhaps there is, and rightly so, a cause of concern as of now and it‚Äôs a question of time, that has been triggered by this wave of rather very unfamiliar sexual practices that to many minds out there pose great danger to the family unit and society in general no matter what the justification and human rights issues in support of such practices may be elsewhere.

It is not news anymore that the Church of Uganda recently announced that it had commenced the process of a formal split with the Church of Canterbury on the basis that the latter had gone against the key tenets of Christianity by giving a green light to priests to bless same-sex and civil marriages.

This stance by the seat of the Anglican church in the world is, understandably, not palatable to the Church of Uganda that has been consistent in its position against anything to do with homosexuality.

On the basis that homosexuality was now a real danger to society as seen from various video clips on social media and media reports, Hon Asuman Basailirwa introduced the Anti-Homosexuality Bill that makes provision for various offences and penalties related to homosexuality. This Bill was debated and passed within commendable timelines and parliament deserves credit for this.

We now wait to see if we can have consistence in turnaround times for churning out the other laws, some of which have been shelved for over a year now.

The Bill makes it an offence for an adult to have sexual relations with another of the same sex. This is regardless of whether the individuals involved are consenting adults and the penalty once convicted is imprisonment for life.



Life imprisonment in this instance means imprisonment for one‚Äôs entire life with no chance for parole. The challenge with such a provision is that it may be construed as unconstitutional, especially in light of Article 21 (2) of the Constitution that bars discrimination against any person on grounds of sex, social standing or disability. The same Constitution in Article 31 (2) (a) expressly prohibits marriages between persons of the same sex but does not prohibit sexual relations between persons of the same sex as it does not expressly prohibit fornication.

Further Article 36 of the Constitution makes provision for the rights of minorities and espouses the need for minorities like in this case persons that subscribe to unconventional sexual practices to have their views and interests taken into account.

Legislating on matters to do with sexual orientation particularly involving consenting adults is a fluid subject and this offence is, if it is passed into law, likely to be interrogated by the Constitutional Court.

The Bill further creates an offence against any person who owns, manages or occupies premises and knowingly allows such premises to be used for homosexuality. The penalty for this offence, if convicted, is imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years.

In essence this provision enjoins all landlords to ensure that they know what goes on in the private rooms of their tenants. The danger with such a provision is ascertaining knowledge of the landlord or manager of a premise as the case may be.

It is not realistic to assume that landlords or managers of such premises may at any time have knowledge of what happens between two consenting adults, especially when it comes to private premises whose tenancy is hinged on contractual obligations requiring the landlord to ensure that the tenant quietly enjoys such demised premises.

While the Bill is a tremendous effort to save the younger generation of Ugandans and the country generally against homosexuality, some of the provisions of this Bill are matters that could better be guided by the moral campus as opposed to legislation.</text>

    <title>Women in informal cross-border trade</title>

    <text>Women in informal cross-border trade (WICBT) make a major contribution to trade in most African countries. Across Africa, women represent 70‚Äì80 percent of the participants in informal cross-border trade involved in buying and selling goods across borders largely at a small scale.

If properly organised, informal traders can have positive macro-economic and socio-economic benefits, alleviate food insecurity and help promote income generation. In Central and West Africa, WICBT generates about 40 to 60 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. This calls for harnessing the leadership and accountability of government institutions to commit to integrating WICBT issues into policies, programmes, and plans.

The AfCFTA has the potential to expand women‚Äôs access to skills and education while expanding their role in the economy. However, for WICBT to reap these rewards African countries need to adopt reforms in trade policy that reduce discrimination against women while building the significant human capital that women represent.

The AfCFTA provides an opportunity for women, giving them a good start toward increasing their economic empowerment and incomes. Opportunities from intra African trade have increased women‚Äôs house incomes, which in turn has a positive effect on the overall investment in health and education and other sectors.

Under the AfCFTA, women have greater opportunities due to the tariff reductions promised under the Protocol on Trade in Goods. For instance women in agriculture value chains have a comparative advantage by trading on the AfCFTA‚Äôs Protocol on Rules of Origin that permits accessibility to cheap raw materials.



However, the intra-Africa trade potential is undermined by the challenges that women face. The contribution of WICBT is much less than it could be because of various non-tariff barriers that impinge heavily on the trade activities of women. These challenges push WICBT into the informal economy which is characterised by the lack of adequate trade information, access to finance, and network hindering their capacity to grow and expand their businesses.

A big number of women in cross-border trade are illiterate with limited information on trade and fear travelling by formal routes. In most cases, these women have weak bargaining power and are forced to use informal routes to avoid being harassed by border officials. Others are reluctant to take formal routes if the goods they trade in might be considered illegal and would be confiscated at the border checkpoint. Such conditions prevent women from taking full advantage of the opportunities created by trade and this undermines the growth of AfCFTA.



To avoid such situations and make gains, WICBT are forced to travel through informal routes. And by travelling through these routes, they can avoid paying hefty levies, taxes, customs duties, and other charges. By avoiding cumbersome bureaucratic custom procedures, regulations, and non-tariff barriers, traders taking informal routes can significantly reduce transaction costs.

Given the significant contribution of WICBT to intra-African trade, it is important to support this sector and ensure that women entrepreneurs leverage emerging trade opportunities and expanding markets. To be able to achieve this AfCFTA trade negotiators and policy specialists must successfully integrate the challenges women traders face into AfCFTA provisions while monitoring the success of AfCFTA provisions in addressing these challenges.</text>

    <title>There is a future in performing arts for those who can make it to rehearsals</title>

    <text>My diary during the Easter holiday week was filled with school performances and visits. I kept some of the appointments out of love‚ÄîI am a parent, that is what we do‚Äîand for the others, it was by invitation. The school shows had a few things in common; big or small, they were all incredibly well organised and the productions had an African theme. In the case where show participants were in my house, I had watched them rehearse, read scripts and I had even dropped them off for recording sessions. School shows these days are no joke: Where we had only teachers coaching us back in the day, now you have choreographers, a production crew and the whole shebang.

Ask me, I once had to attend many rehearsals with a professional dance coach for a parents‚Äô dance at a school concert. All the dance moves I had failed to master during my secondary school days, I grasped as a 30-something mama. Last week, I learnt that I have a talented actor in my household and a dancer I had never seen in action. Teachers can really work some magic.

The second school show I attended last week was big, colourful and professionally done. Coming at it from a point of ignorance‚Äîas a first time attendee‚Äî I marvelled at the stage setup, lighting, the dance choreography and the order in the mass student choirs at Taibah International School‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe unmasking of Egwugwu‚Äù concert. In my head, it was all about the work they had done for this one show. Only later, when I spoke to the principal, Oskar Semweya-Musoke, did I learn the 20-year backstory, which was an education on the challenges of performing arts in this country. The school first held shows in 2001 at the National Theatre with the attendant issues; including the size of the theatre, the state and maintenance of its facilities, among other things. In later years, they tried other facilities and did not fare much better until the school opted for the pricier option to host and produce their shows on their own premises. Finally, they could have performances on their terms in conjunction with some industry professionals. In many ways, the principal said, this was their best show. Our schools are grooming some fine talent and it worries me that our children who are oriented towards the arts will soon find themselves in a sector with facilities whose quality never quite crossed over from the 20th Century. It is scandalous that we have not graduated from the one 400- seater national theatre, which according to historical records on architectuul.com was designed to cater for the needs of the small expatriate community resident in Kampala at the time and was opened in 1959 after an Act of Parliament had established the Uganda National Cultural Centre.

Like competitive sports, only those who can afford the right training, equipment and tools will thrive in performing arts. When the State does not see where the potential for its youth lies, we shall continue to function in the remaining narrow spaces that exist for the performing arts. Even the little that exists will only be protected by those who carry the passion or those who can see that far into the future. Our schools are doing a stellar job teaching music, dance and drama but where are the spaces where these talents will be showcased? Performing arts will remain a preserve of those who can afford rehearsals and a concert venue.</text>

    <text>Several days back, Simba FM featured voices of some of the beneficiaries of the government policy of doling out money to elderly people.

The sample voices were mainly in Kayunga District. Listening to them was a painful experience.

For the record, their Shs25,000 monthly allowance was initially supposed to be bigger, and for citizens above 60 or 65. At implementation, the figure came down and the age apparently went up to 80.

Now, if we searched for the most dubious of all the dubious policies under the NRM government, this scheme would be a very strong contender.

Apart from age, what are the other criteria used to decide who qualifies?

If it is not by random chance, you would suppose it is the very old who are not on a government pension or some other institutional retirement scheme, and who have no investment or savings to turn to. But many of these people seem not to be beneficiaries of the new scheme.

Uganda being now a vampire state, is it possible that functionaries variously involved in implementation reap more from the scheme than the ‚Äòlucky‚Äô elders?

The samples of lucky elders Simba FM interviewed spoke of the misery of being a beneficiary.

Starting with the amount, Shs25,000 (less than $7) entitles the elder to exactly 1¬Ω kg of ordinary beef. Or 4kg of rice. Or 5kg of beans. Or 3kg of groundnuts.

As I have noted, the procedure followed and the criteria are something of a mystery, even to the elders themselves.

Then, once listed, there is the nightmare of the elder trying to follow whatever looks or smells like progress in the bureaucracy that processes the payments. Our people call this ‚Äòchasing‚Äô, without which almost all Uganda‚Äôs institutions under NRM rule deliver nothing.

Not to have read the work of Franz Kafka is to be illiterate. And many of our elderly folk out there are illiterate. But their experience reminds us of the illusions, frustration and despair in Kafka‚Äôs stories.

From their voices, the beneficiaries spend amazing lengths of time and phone airtime, not to mention costly journeys to the LC and district offices, before they get their hands on this tiny pittance.

Some beneficiaries face repeated identification issues.

Beneficiaries are sometimes given a specific date, only to reach the relevant office and be given another date.

For reasons that again are not clear, it seems common for a beneficiary to miss out on several months‚Äô payments, making a mockery of what is supposedly a monthly allowance.

Thinking about the elderly inevitably brings up the youth.

Over the years, the NRM government has squandered ‚Äì and its officials stolen ‚Äì trillions of shillings on populist policies and misguided youth programmes.

Now we have millions of young people who hate or despise honest serious work and are encouraged by NRM politicians to imagine getting rich quickly from petty cash handouts once or twice every five-year presidential term.

Above the ordinary old people and youth and their misery, NRM rule has engineered layers of privilege; from ministers and MPs to all sorts of local government elder and youth leaders.

Most of them are cynically elevated to fool their constituents that there is an ideological commitment to significantly improve all their livelihoods, but in reality adding to the burden of maintaining the vampire state.

This in turn only prolongs the lamentation and humiliation of the elders of Kayunga District. Why not leave them to die without mockery or illusions?

An alternative government would increase their pittance and spread it more rationally.</text>

    <title>Let curriculum review speak to other problems</title>

    <text>The National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), a corporate autonomous statutory institution under the Ministry of Education and Sports, has announced plans to review the primary school curriculum. The deputy director for Research, Consultancy and Library Services at NCDC, Dr Richard Irumba, has revealed that the process starts in July this year.

The proposed changes in primary education curriculum will involve introducing Swahili, Science and Social Studies to learners in P1, two and three. These subjects are currently introduced to the learners from P4. The primary curriculum was last reviewed in 2007.

These reforms are long overdue. However, our view is that as a country, we must go beyond introducing new subjects, and begin to question the permeating problems in the sector. Recent research by the Education ministry, Uneb and the evaluation department under the NCDC indicated that children were reaching P7 without knowing how to read and write. This problem was evident in how pupils answered Uneb questions. This explains why 97,109 candidates failed 2022 PLE.

The government foot-dragging on feeding learners under UPLE, has also complicated matters. To have meaningful reforms in the education sector, our view is that these fundamental issues, be looked into seriously. Let‚Äôs focus on skills and emphasise learner-centred approaches in all subjects and language competences. The current education system is too theoretical and academic oriented.

The sector is erratic, unhinged and limping with inadequate funding and disgruntled workforce. We must invest in the education sector to be able to provide instructional materials at all levels, strengthen the training of teachers, and provide housing for teachers, increase salaries for all teachers without discrimination and provide accommodation particularly for head teachers, especially in the hard-to-reach areas of Uganda.

We need people with the competencies to achieve the country‚Äôs development goals and aspirations. It‚Äôs important that we adopt a smart curriculum that speaks to the poverty situation and other challenges we are grappling with as a country. The resource allocation to education sector is another hurdle. It won‚Äôt be surprising that the Shs180b NCDC needs for the planned curriculum review, requires concerted lobbying at the higher places of government.</text>

    <title>How police continue to disobey court rulings by enforcing POMA</title>

    <text>For most youth in most penurious parts of Uganda, football is not a pastime. It is a craving and a purpose, offering the dream of escape from the grim wearisomeness in these abandoned communities.

Yet football is so deeply entangled with politics that it simply cannot ignore it. Football is not something that has recently been politicised. It has frequently been the venue at which political and social issues are played out, for better or worse.

Politicians tap into football as they look to win or retain political positions and that was the case when Joel Ssenyonyi ‚Äì the Nakawa West Member of Parliament (MP) ‚Äì organised a football tournament whose climax was to be on Easter day.

All was set, but police at the last minute came in and chased away all those that had gathered on grounds that organisers had not notified them.

At Ssenyonyi‚Äôs gathering, no arrests were made but one day later, seven disenchanted Makerere University students who attempted to organise a press conference weren‚Äôt that lucky as they were brutally arrested on charges of holding an illegal assembly.

The arrests come after the Constitutional Court last month nullified Sections 5 and 11 of the Public Order Management Act (POMA) which in a way gave police powers to ask organisers of public gatherings to give it notice.

Section 5 of POMA stipulated that: ‚ÄúNotice of public meeting (1) An organiser shall give notice in writing signed by the organiser or his or her agent to the authorised officer of the intention to hold a public meeting, at least three days but not more than 15 days before the proposed date of the public meeting.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn organiser or his or her agent who holds a public meeting without any reasonable excuse and fails to comply with the conditions set out in Section 5 of the said Act commits an offense of disobedience of statutory duty and is liable on conviction to serve two years.

Section 10 of POMA stipulated: ‚ÄúAn organiser or his or her agent shall (a) be responsible for adhering to the required criteria for holding public meetings; (b) inform all participants of the traffic or assembly plan and provide sufficient stewards proportionate to the number of participants in the public meeting who shall be clearly identified with name tags; (c) coordinate and cooperate with the police to ensure that all participants are unarmed and peaceful.‚Äù

POMA‚Äôs Section 10 further stipulated that an organiser must ensure that statements made to the media and public by the organiser do not conflict with any law; ensure that the public meeting is concluded peacefully by 7pm; be present at the public meeting and coordinate and corporate with the police to maintain peace and order; A person who participates in a public meeting shall act in a manner that ensures that obstruction of traffic, confusion or disorder is avoided. A person who contravenes this Section 10 of POMA was liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding 24 currency points, or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both.

The two sections came under contestation in 2018 when musician-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, alias Bobi Wine, with four others were arrested and charged with staging unlawful assembly after participating in a protest against the government‚Äôs move to tax social media.

Buganda Road Court Magistrate Doreen Olga Karungi, first referred the matter to the Constitutional Court such that it can interpret if Sections 5 and 10 of POMA are indeed consistent with the Constitution, particularly Article 29.

In normal constitutional petitions, it‚Äôs the Attorney General who defends actions by the State, but in this constitutional reference it was prosecutors from the office of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) that served that purpose and indeed they wanted Sections 5 and 10 to remain on Uganda‚Äôs legal books.

The DPP submitted that the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 29 (1) (a) of the 1995 Constitution and the right to freedom to assemble and to demonstrate together with others peacefully and unarmed and to petition guaranteed under Article 29 (1) (d) are not absolute and may be subject to lawful limitations in accordance with Article 43.

The DPP submitted that, under Article 43 (L), such derogations may be necessary to protect the rights of others or to protect the public interest. In her analysis, Justice Elizabeth Musoke, who wrote the lead judgment, said the fact that Sections 5 (b) and 10 (3) and (4) of POMA provide for the imposition of penal sanctions on organisers and participants in peaceful albeit unauthorised demonstrations is disproportionate for achieving the intended purpose of ensuring orderly public meetings.

‚ÄúMore proportionate measures would involve asking the organisers to disband illegal meetings, failing which the authorities would then disperse the illegal meetings. It is only in the event of actual violence that it would be necessary to impose penal sanctions against the perpetrators of the violence. I would, therefore, find that the imposition of a penal sanction under Section 5 (B) and Sections 10 (3) and (4) of the POMA is disproportionate for purposes of ensuring orderly meetings and constitutes limitations that are not acceptable and demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society and that contravene Article 29 (1) (d) of the 1995 Constitution,‚Äù Justice Musoke ruled.

Sections 5 and 10 of POMA, 2013, Justice Musoke said to the extent that they impose penal sanctions on organisers and participants in peaceful albeit unauthorised public meetings, including demonstrations and assemblies, contravene Article 29 (1) (d) of the 1995 Constitution and are, therefore, null and void.

‚ÄúI would declare that the charges against the accused persons that were based on their participation in a peaceful albeit unauthorised public meeting constituted an impermissible limitation on their right to freedom of assembly, and contravene Article 29 (1) (d) of the 1995 Constitution,‚Äù she said.

This latest Constitutional Court judgment comes three years after another Constitutional Court panel ‚Äì Geoffrey Kiryabwire, Cheborion Barishaki, Elizabeth Musoke, Stephen Musota and Kenneth Kakuru ‚Äì annulled Section 8 of POMA.

Inspector General of Police John Martins Okoth-Ochola



Initially, the petitioners ‚Äì Human Rights Network Uganda, Indigenous Voluntary Associations, FIDA, Butambala County MP Muhammad Muwanga Kivumbi, and Bishop Zack Niringiye ‚Äì asked the Constitutional Court in 2013 to quash the entire Public Order Management Act, but later they amended the petition asking them to quash only Section 8 of POMA, which granted the Inspector General of Police unrestricted powers to stop public gatherings, thinking that without that Section the entire Act would be left with no bite.

Justice Barishaki, who wrote the lead judgment in 2020, said although he found it rather unusual and imprudent for the petitioners to let other sections of POMA stand, he had no option but to go with the new position since the petitioners had the right to prosecute their case as they deemed fit.

Justice Barishaki reprimanded both the Executive and Legislature when he agreed with the petitioner‚Äôs argument that POMA was passed into law to undercut the Constitutional Court‚Äôs judgment that nullified Section 32(2) of the Police Act ‚Äì in what‚Äôs known popularly in the legal circles as the ‚ÄòMuwanga Kivumbi case‚Äô.

For the uninitiated, in his constitutional petition of 2005, Kivumbi, who is now a Butambala County legislator, fruitfully challenged Section 32 (2) of the Police Act, which gave police powers to regulate public gatherings and Justice Barishaki wasn‚Äôt happy that Section 8 of POMA was trying to weaken that judgment.

‚ÄúWithout any hesitation, therefore, I find that the provisions of Section 8 of the Public Order Management Act, 2013, are in pari materia with the nullified Section 32 (2) of the Police Act. The justices of the Constitutional Court who determined Muwanga Kivumbi vs Attorney General laboured to explain in individual judgments, the reasons why the police cannot be permitted to have powers to stop the holding of a public gathering, including a protest or demonstration ostensibly on grounds that such public meetings would cause a breach of the peace. It is a pity that their explanations of nullifying Section 32 (2) of the Police Act were contemptuously ignored by Parliament and the Executive,‚Äù Justice Barishaki ruled.

‚ÄúAll efforts must be made by all arms of government to protect this young constitutional democracy. The enactment of Section 8 of POMA by the Legislature following this court‚Äôs decision striking down a similar provision in the Police Act was a blatant attempt at disregarding the checks on legislative powers.‚Äù

Justice Kakuru, who has since passed on, had no kind words with the way the police were enforcing POMA.

‚ÄúClearly its principle purpose, as discernible from Section 8, is to enable the police to suppress enjoyment of a constitutionally guaranteed freedom of assembly using very arbitrary measures... In my view, law enforcers, particularly the police force, believe that POMA empowers them to ban or violently disperse public meetings of a political nature or even social gatherings organised by certain categories of individuals. This is most unfortunate,‚Äù he said.

A police officer pepper-sprays journalists covering the arrest of pre-medical interns who attempted to march to Parliament on Tuesday.

‚ÄúIt is for that reason that this court must express itself unequivocally that the police have absolutely no legal authority to stop the holding of public gatherings on grounds of alleged possible breach of peace if such gatherings are allowed to proceed.‚Äù

It‚Äôs now three years after the judges made themselves clear, but police still foil Opposition gatherings with National Unity Planform (NUP) feeling this crackdown when its mobilisation gathering in the western district of Kyenjojo was last week violently dispersed on grounds that it was ‚Äúan illegal assembly‚Äù.</text>

    <title>You can make quick bucks now by scamming iron sheet ministers</title>

    <text>This is entirely pro bono trick up my nostril and it works. Even after the culprits read it here, they will still be as hopeless as a third degree bald man is in a comb shop.

Believe you me, even a presidential secretary can spend days or weeks without coming close to the old man. Some of these ministers only see him on TV like you, me and Kitutu ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt really mean the minister who, at the time of filing this column, was in Luzira trying to solve the riddle of the egg and the hen.

Word is that a warder teased that if Kitutu answered which of the egg and hen came first, they would connect her to the President using Afande Byabashaija‚Äôs telephone. She has been working her head since and might not have that mop of hair when she is finally a free minister.

I tell you, those iron sheets suspects who have been hogging VVIP syndrome are now so desperate you can make quick bucks by scamming them. And this is entirely legit in the grand scheme of things.

First, like that one spending day and night trying to answer the egg-hen riddle, you can position yourself as someone close to so-and-so who works in the State House. It doesn‚Äôt matter the name you throw at them -- they don‚Äôt know most of the State House workers anyway.

Just play around with believable lies like ‚Äúoh, my auntie is the one who carries the tray of letters and petitions to the President‚Äôs desk.‚Äù Then regale them with stories of how a letter can be smuggled in after protocol has checked and approved the in-coming and how the last contact person can also keep a letter from reaching the big man.

Right now you are all believing what you have read this far. So am I. That is the beauty of a lie. A starved dog will eat grass. For Shs200m, you promise a minister that you will not only ensure that the President reads their plea but also believe it and forgive them.

To spice things up, claim you are the one who made MK discard Gashumba. These guys have seen firsthand how Kitutu has been made to understand that it‚Äôs only in the Bible that talks of ‚Äúwise men come from the east‚Äù is tolerable.

The thing is, if you go after Minister A, you get the bucks but don‚Äôt stop there. Return to them again with that true lie and they will pay up again having long forgotten that they had already paid up.

The fear of Luzira is not a small matter. If in doubt, ask Mukula. You know one day that chap thought he was a wise man from the east. He declared he would run for the highest office in the land.

Suddenly, a whirlwind swept him so viciously that when he woke up, a loan shark was threatening his Bugos pad and he was in Luzira over this and that. He renounced that presidential ambition nonsense and swore that Soroti is in the yeast not east.

Meanwhile, if you are twice as smart, you can even set up a shrine. When an African is nervous, he will go to pastors, shrines and even the toilet. Tell them you can make the President forget about the iron sheets scandal by just throwing some cowries and slaughtering a red duck under a mvule tree at midnight.

The red duck will go for Shs500m, you will say. Other paraphernalia like a white linen, a gay cockroach and a mosquito that has lived for 37 years will be brought from Luweero Triangle where the NRA were based. It will be completed with a dog‚Äôs egg picked from Rwakitura.

Meanwhile, don‚Äôt forget to set up a loan shark briefcase willing to give the ministers that float at 200 percent interest. They won‚Äôt notice the zeros. Or they will only see one zero under the influence of desperation.

Like I said, this is an entirely pro bono tip given to me by a man so short he needs a stool to reach a comb up his own hair.</text>

    <title>Why do Ugandans tolerate corruption?</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/magazines/people-power/why-do-ugandans-tolerate-corruption--4200202</url>
    <author>[]</author>
    <date>2023-04-15 09:20:29+00:00</date>
    <text>Last Sunday, I explained why Ugandans are frustrated with corruption, urge the government to clamp down on it, President Museveni pays lip service to the fight against corruption, but most of the time turns a blind eye to it.

Sunday Monitor columnist Harold Acemah asked me to write a sequel, this time examining another intriguing angle: Why do Ugandans tolerate those who condone corruption?

Or, to put it differently, why do Ugandans, just as President Museveni, tolerate corruption while appearing to hate and denounce it?

In 2004 while he was station manager of 93.3 KFM, the journalist Andrew Mwenda made an important observation to me as we conversed one afternoon in his office two floors above Daily Monitor newsrooms.

Mwenda said Ugandans and Museveni have arrived at an equilibrium.

Museveni reads the mood and attitude of Ugandan society and responds accordingly, as I explained last week, and he responds accordingly.

So, for example, when a prominent public official from Rukungiri is arrested, a delegation of prominent politicians, religious leaders, and elders from Rukungiri visits Museveni at State House and pleads for clemency for their son.

On one hand, we demand accountability in public office but want exceptions for our tribesmen when they embezzle public funds.

This equilibrium keeps Uganda relatively stable.

A lot of this is now structural and built into the reality of Uganda over the last 30 years.

From the 1950s to early 1990s, civil servants and other government officials lived in government-owned houses in the various towns around the country.

This was crucial, because the one headache they did not have to worry about was rent. They could focus on their jobs and generally be honest at it.

Fees at the leading government schools was also quite affordable.

In 1975, the leading government-owned primary schools in Kampala, Mbale, Jinja, and Entebbe was Shs150 a term.

Shs150 of 1975 in today‚Äôs monetary value adjusted for inflation is about Shs106,000 or Shs107,000.

Fees in secondary schools was Shs250 per term.

Just think about this for a moment. Imagine the leading primary schools today charging Shs106,000 a term.

Why would any civil servant be corrupt when he or she lived rent-free in a government house in the Boma residential area of town and if they had five young children, the total school fees in a term would be about Shs550,000 in 2023 money.

Today, the average primary school fees are around Shs700,000 a term.

All this demonstrates why corruption is so rife in Uganda and also why news stories of corruption in government were few and far in between in the 1960s and 1970s, but explode in the 1990s.

It‚Äôs not so much that society has suddenly turned immoral and dishonest as it is that Ugandans are struggling with an incredibly high cost of living.

About 50 years ago in the 1970s, you really had to be a crook to be corrupt; today, you really have to be a near-saint to not be corrupt.

But even in the 1970s and 1980s, the severe shortage of basic consumer goods and high inflation eroded the value of civil servants‚Äô salaries and wages, resulting in a black market (magendo) in both goods and foreign exchange to emerge.

Letters to the editor of the government-owned Uganda Times newspaper in the early 1980s have readers complaining about applying for a telephone connection and deliberately being delayed by post office technicians soliciting a bribe, or nurses at Jinja Hospital also asking for a bribe to attend to outpatients.

In the 1970s during the Idi Amin period right through the Yusuf Lule and Godfrey Binaisa UNLF period, and the Obote II period, to get such items as beer and soda for one‚Äôs wedding or at Christmas and Easter, people who knew Cabinet ministers or top army officers took written chits from them to bottling plants and were allocated a crate or two.

Scarcity was at the root of all this.

Today we no longer read letters in newspapers complaining about a failure to get a phone line, not because technicians have become honest but because the digital revolution has so changed telecommunications that supply now far exceeds demand.

Wherever demand is much greater than supply (passport office, government jobs, government contracts, private sector jobs, etc.), we see the pattern of nepotism, bribery, and frustrating delays.

The high cost of living in rent, school fees, and medical bills has eroded Ugandans‚Äô disposable income and this is reflected in the mostly empty hotel rooms, restaurant tables, and low traffic to shops and supermarkets.

And yet the Uganda Revenue Authority is increasingly aggressive in extracting taxes from the business community.

The result is that it is very difficult to break even in business in the present Ugandan economy if one pays one‚Äôs taxes in full.

In 2021 when I asked a businessman in Gulu what the biggest challenge was that he faced, he said to succeed at business in Uganda today ‚ÄúYou either evade taxes or you must have a political godfather.‚Äù

This honestly-stated view by the Gulu businessman takes us back to why Museveni and other powerful political leaders are so powerful, why Museveni tolerates public corruption and why prominent Ugandans condemn it but live with it.

That‚Äôs why South African supermarket chains like Shoprite and Game that adhere to best practices such as paying their taxes and NSSF employee contributions leave the Ugandan market but many Ugandan supermarkets remain in business.

Without tax evasion, without corruption in other words, at least 95 percent of present Ugandan businesses will fold.

Corruption in Uganda that is, at heart, mostly an economic problem, is treated as a moral problem by the media, the church, civil society groups, and the political class.

Museveni, for his part, recognises this and his patronage system and turning a blind eye to tax evasion and bribery is his way of preventing society from getting to the brink of all-out crisis if he were to be tough on corruption.</text>

    <title>URA gives car importers, owners 10 days to vacate Coin Bond</title>

    <date>2023-04-14 08:28:55+00:00</date>
    <text>Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) has directed importers and owners to clear out all motor vehicle units warehoused in Coin Bond in Nakawa Kampala.

In a notice issued yesterday, URA indicated that the commissioner customs had taken a decision to close Coin Bond, noting that no importer or owner would be expected to deposit a motor vehicle in the said facility.

‚ÄúThe Commissioner Customs notifies the general public about the closure of Coin Bond, as such, no motor vehicle units shall be deposited in the said facility with effect from March 22,‚Äù the notice reads in part, adding: ‚ÄúThe Commissioner Customs calls upon all owners of motor vehicles that are still warehoused in this bond to clear them out within ten [10] days ‚Ä¶ for either home consumption, exportation or removal to another licenced bond.‚Äù

Coin is one of the largest bonds that warehouses used motor vehicle in Uganda. It covers a long stretch on Jinja Road.

Mr Ibrahim Bbosa, the URA assistant commissioner for public and corporate affairs, yesterday told Monitor, the bond had been closed over a land wrangle, which had existed over a long period of time.

‚ÄúIn our conditions for licensing bonds, it is not sustainable to have a bond whose existence is not guaranteed. So, there have been some back and forth between them and us where we have advised them to take the vehicles to other bonds. Their latest communication to Commissioner Customs was requesting for more time, so that the car owners in the bond are able to pay their demurrage. Otherwise, if they just go away they will lose the demurrage,‚Äù he said, noting that they had provided the option of relocating vehicles to other bonds because their licence as a bonded warehouse for vehicles is not tenable now given their challenges.

However, Mr Bbosa did not give details of the nature of the land wrangle between Coin Bond and their landlord.

Sources close to the matter, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about the matter, told Monitor the bond was being closed because of a land wrangle that has existed for more than 28 years.

The wrangle, sources said, is between Coin Bond and the landlord, whose details we could not readily establish.

However, sources noted, the landlord had recently won a court case, which in essence requires Coin Bond to vacate the land.

we could not readily get a comment from proprietors of Coin Bond.

    <text>Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) has said it is in the process of conducting a cost analysis for the Umeme concession buyout, which, among others includes verifying recoverable investments.

Speaking in an interview yesterday, Eng Ziria Tibalwa Waako, the ERA chief executive officer, told Monitor the process to verify investments was yet to be completed, adding that the final buyout amount is expected to be revealed in March 2025 after the Auditor General has conducted cost and technical audits.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt completed the verification process. It is just ongoing. I have seen numbers in newspapers. I am not sure who is giving those numbers,‚Äù she said, declining a request to estimate how much government would need for the buyout.

‚ÄúI cannot give you a figure before the process has been completed,‚Äù she said.

However, on Tuesday Energy Permanent Secretary Irene Bateebe, had told the Parliamentary Committee on Environment and Natural Resources that the Umeme buyout, as of December last year, stood at Shs799b ($215m), which would be subject to an investment cost analysis.

Government last year indicated it would allow Umeme‚Äôs 20-year concession to come to a natural end. The concession is due to expire in 2025.

Electricity distribution is expected to revert to government under a new company that will be in charge of Uganda‚Äôs power sector.

Government is also trying to boost capacity of Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UEDCL), which owns the assets that were concessioned to Umeme.

Ms Bateebe, during the Parliamentary meeting, told MPs that UEDCL would require at least Shs587b ($158m) to invest in the distribution system in the next three years.

However, she said, Umeme is currently investing in some assets, part of which is recovered through tariffs.

‚ÄúOn an ongoing basis, Umeme is investing and ERA has a recovery mechanism where they recover part of this investment from the tariff. The Umeme concession and the asset remained on the books of UEDCL and the agreement provides for an option where UEDCL can come in and invest today,‚Äù she said.

Ms Bateebe also said UEDCL, whose assets were leased to Umeme, needs a capitalisation of $64m ( as a way of building its capacity), which will form part of government‚Äôs plan to fully takeover the electricity sector.

Umeme is currently Uganda‚Äôs largest power distributor with a customer base of about 1.75 million connections on the national grid.

In its financial report for the period ended 2022, Umeme indicated it would execute its mandate of electricity distribution up to the very end of concession before, transitioning and handing back leased assets to government.

In the same report, Umeme reported that profit after tax had increased to Shs148b from Shs139b in 2021, while earnings had marginally increased to Shs1.887 trillion from Shs1.885 trillion in 2021.</text>

    <title>URA asks persons involved in agricultural business to get TINs</title>

    <text>Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) has said any person dealing in agricultural business with an annual turnover of Shs150m must acquire a tax identification number (TIN) for onward tax assessment and payment.

In a tax sensitisation notice published early this week, URA indicated that any person dealing in agricultural business must acquire a TIN, which they must at all time quote in all business transaction documents.

Such persons, URA added are also required to keep business records for a minimum of five years, file income tax returns and pay the tax due and withhold pay as you earn at the appropriate rates from employees earning above Shs235,000 per month.

‚ÄúCommercial farmers are required to register for value added tax (VAT), to enable them claim a refund on VAT on farming input,‚Äù the notice reads in part.

URA has in the last three years sought to widen the tax base by bringing taxable categories of business in the tax fold, while at the same time putting in place measures to close tax leakages. In December last year, URA warned persons earning an income from entertainment to obtain TINs or face penalties.

Mr Robert Wamala Lumanyika, the URA acting manager public and corporate affairs, told Monitor yesterday that whereas many people have claimed this is a new tax, it has been in place and URA was only plugging into areas that have previously been low on compliance to increase the tax base.

Under the Income Tax Act, he said, everyone with a chargeable income is supposed to pay income tax.

‚ÄúSo, if a person or business sells birds, maize or matooke and earns an annual turnover of, say Shs10m you will not be expected to file the return. But if you exceed Shs150m, you must file,‚Äù he said, noting that this is because farmers are under the category of small taxpayers.

However, he noted, farmers who are into commercial agriculture, will be required to register for valued added tax given that they are adding value, some of whom are entitled to VAT refunds on certain items.

Former agriculture minister Victoria Sekitoleko, yesterday said URA should get out of Kampala and make use of make use government programmes to educate farmers about the benefits and why they should pay taxes.</text>

    <title>URA wrong not to use value of used cars in determining taxes, court rules</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/markets/ura-wrong-not-to-use-value-of-used-cars-in-determining-taxes-court-rules--4197456</url>
    <author>[]</author>
    <date>2023-04-13 06:48:07+00:00</date>
    <text>Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) has failed to overturn a judgement, in which it was found not to have powers to suspend use of the transaction value method in determining the customs value of an imported used vehicle.

The case stems from an August 7, 2013 judgement in favour of Testimony Motors, an importer of used vehicles, in which, in 2012, challenged powers of the URA commissioner customs at the Commercial Division of the High Court to omit the method.

Court heard that on July 30, 2010, Testimony Motors imported, a used motor vehicle from Japan and entered the same for customs purposes with a declared transaction value of $5,200 (11.6m) out of which it would pay taxes of $3,588 (about 8m) at the then considered dollar rate of Shs2,232.

However, URA rejected Testimony Motors‚Äô declared value and instead appraised the importer using the fall back method, which increased the customs duty to Shs19.5m.

Therefore, in a 2012 ruling delivered by trial Judge Christopher Madrama, court found that URA had acted illegally when it excluded the transaction value method, which the importer had used for onward payment of taxes.

Court also ordered for re-assessment of the motor vehicle for customs duty and that, if it were found that Testimony Motors had paid over the assessed taxes, the excess would be refunded, with interest 2l percent per annum from the date of overpayment.

Testimony Motors was also awarded Shs20m in aggravated damages, interest thereon and costs.

However, dissatisfied with decision of the trial Judge, URA filed an appeal, praying for a ruling to quash the decision of the Commercial Division of the High Court, which had effectively abolished the use of alternative methods of valuation of imported used cars.

In the appeal, URA argued that the trial Judge had erred when he held that the Commissioner Customs had no powers under the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004 to exclude the transaction value method as the primary method of valuation.

However, in a judgement delivered by a coram of three judges led by Justice Catherine Bamugemeireire, the Court of Appeal concurred with the trail Judge, noting that the Commissioner Customs had no powers to exclude the transaction value method and that the act of URA using a fall back method was unlawful.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ it can be surmised that the ‚Ä¶ customs value of imported goods is primarily the transaction value method,‚Äù court ruled, noting that if URA had followed the sequence as provided for in the Fourth Schedule [of the East African Community Customs Management Act], it would have found the sequence of valuing imported goods, which falls in the order of transaction value, transaction value of identical goods, transaction value of similar goods, reversal of order of application of deductive value and computed values, deductive value, computed value and fall Back Value. Instead, court noted, URA decided to jump the sequence to use the fall back value method, instead of the first option of transaction value method.

‚ÄúI, therefore, find no justification for [URA] deciding to use the fall back method yet the Act is specific on the procedure in case the transaction value method is not used,‚Äù court ruled, but also set aside aggravated damages of Shs20m, citing that URA was not accompanied with any malice or arrogance thus the trial Judge erred in making the award.

Other judges included Justice Richard Butera and Justice Stephen Musoto.</text>

    <title>Financial stability risks have risen, says IMF</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/finance/financial-stability-risks-have-risen-says-imf-4197434</url>
    <author>[]</author>
    <date>2023-04-13 06:19:18+00:00</date>
    <text>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that global financial stability risks have risen with resilience of the global financial system facing severe tests.

The financial system, the IMF said in the Global Financial Stability report, is being tested by high inflation and rising interest rates at a time when inflationary pressures in many countries remain above central bank targets.

The sudden failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US and the loss of market confidence in Credit Suisse, a global systemically important bank in Europe, have been a powerful reminder of the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities.

However, Dr Tobias Adrian, the IMF financial counsellor and director of monetary and capital markets, said that while the banking turmoil has raised financial stability risks, its roots are fundamentally different from those of the global financial crisis.

‚ÄúThe recent turmoil is different. The banking system has much more capital and funding to weather adverse shocks, off balance sheet entities have been unwound, and credit risks have been curbed by more stringent post-crisis regulations. Instead, it was a meeting between the steep and rapid rise in interest rates and fast-growing financial institutions that were unprepared for the rise,‚Äù he said, noting that banks in major emerging economies have so far experienced little contagion from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe.

Early this month, Bank of Uganda noted the heightened volatility in the global financial markets, due to challenges in the US and Swiss banking systems partly on account of valuation losses resulting from interest rate increase, presented threats even as the Ugandan banking system remained well capitalized, highly liquid and well placed to absorb emerging shocks.</text>

    <title>MTN transfers Shs42.7b in dormant accounts to BoU</title>

    <date>2023-04-12 06:31:50+00:00</date>
    <text>MTN transferred Shs42.7b to Bank of Uganda held in 9.35 million dormant mobile money accounts during the period ended December 2022.

The telecom told Monitor yesterday that if the account remains inactive, it engages a subscriber at the ninth month of dormancy, after which, if it remains inactive for the next six months, it is declared dormant.

Details provided by Mr Richard Yego, the MTN Mobile Money managing director, further indicated that the Shs42.7b covered the period between 2009 and 2022.

At least Shs35b held in 7.51 million mobile money accounts had been accumulated between 2009 and 2021.

A mobile money account, MTN said, is declared dormant after 450 days or 15 months of being inactive.

The law now requires telecoms to transfer any money held in dormant accounts to Bank of Uganda.

During 2022, MTN reported 1.83 million dormant mobile money accounts, which held at least Shs7.68b.

Money in dormant accounts can only be redeemed by a third party if the owner of the account has been declared dead.

However, the National Payment Systems Act requires third party claimant to obtain legal representation.

Incidences of telecoms preventing third parties without legal representation from claiming money in accounts of deceased people have been reported.

However, the National Payment Systems Act provides a procedure through which such money can be redeemed and guides on how a telecom can declare a mobile money or electronic money account dormant.

Mr Yego said the dormancy in mobile money accounts mostly results from death yet many surviving relatives may not be aware of how to claim money held in a deceased person‚Äôs account.

‚ÄúSome people never follow up. But because the process is long, by the time it ends the mobile money account might have fallen in the dormancy bracket. You have to provide evidence of whether there was a family meeting guided by the head of the family and administrator general,‚Äù he said, noting that the claimant must have a death certificate and letters of administration that authorise them to administer the deceased‚Äôs estate.

The National Payment systems Act requires telecoms to notify a subscriber, whose account has been inactive for nine months, of a pending suspension ‚Äúunless there is a transaction on such an account‚Äù , after which the account is blocked and there after suspended.

In the event that the account is not reactivated within six months, it is closed and any money on it is transferred to Bank of Uganda, where it is held before it is transferred to the Consolidated Fund if not claimed by the owner or a legal representative.

    <title>Pearl Dairy secures $35m loan to expand into Kenya</title>

    <date>2023-04-12 05:46:17+00:00</date>
    <text>Pearl Dairy Farms, which manufactures the Lato milk brand has secured a $35m (Shs130.2b) loan that will enable it to fund its expansion in Uganda and Kenya.

The loan was secured from the International Finance Corporation, a unit of the World Bank that manages investments in the private sector, and the Dutch development bank FMO.

The loan, which consists of a $21m (Shs78.1b) senior loan and an additional $14m (Shs52.1b) to refinance an existing Standard Chartered Bank loan in Uganda, will support the company‚Äôs capacity expansion plans, which include upgrading and expanding the powder milk plant in Uganda and acquiring a packing plant in Kenya.

Under the Lato brand, the Mbarara-based dairy company, founded in 2009, offers ultra-high temperature milk, powder milk, flavored milk, yogurts, butter, and honey.

Pearl Dairy Farms gets its milk from over 15,000 farmers, with two-thirds of them in Uganda and the other third in Kenya.

Through 80 sales points in the two operating countries, the company distributes its products to retailers, wholesalers, and end-users across the continent.

The expansion is part of the company‚Äôs strategic plan to increase production and distribution capacity, while improving regional competitiveness.

This is not the first time IFC has invested in Pearl Dairy. In 2018, it loaned the company $6.5m to build a cutting-edge milk processing plant in Uganda.

During bilateral talks between Uganda and Kenya following a ban on Uganda‚Äôs milk products, Kenya allowed Uganda‚Äôs Lato to invest in its local dairy factories in an effort to increase competitive advantage.

Uganda‚Äôs milk has on various occasions been blocked from entering Kenya.

Last month, Kenya suspended a decision in which it had indicated that it would unilaterally reduce the import of milk due to expected increase in production as a result of the upcoming rainy season.

However, the decision was rescinded because it violets the East Africa Customs Protocols.

Before, this Kenya had banned powdered milk imports from entering its market, citing the need to protect its milk processors.

However, Uganda reacted, threatening to institute a ban on selected imports from Kenya.</text>

    <text>NCBA Group invested Shs22.6b ($6.08m) into its Ugandan subsidiary for the period ended December 2022.

This was part of the Shs155.83b ($41.89m), which the Kenyan-based financial institution injected into its three subsidiaries in Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda to shore up capital to enhance its competitiveness.

The move is part of the bank‚Äôs efforts to shore up its regional retail banking business and avert more financial bleeding through the struggling subsidiaries.

NCBA, which is listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), disclosed in its annual report that its combined investment in Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania increased by Shs90.9b ($24.46m) in 2022 and Shs64.8b ($17.43m) in 2021.

Last year, the lion‚Äôs share of the additional funding totaling Shs54.6b ($14.96m) went to strengthen operations in the Tanzanian subsidiary, whose losses worsened to Shs49.2b ($13.24m) from Shs31.9b ($8.6m) in 2021. NCBA also injected Shs12.7b ($3.42 million) in Rwanda.

Audited financial statements show the group‚Äôs net profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 grew by 34.76 percent to Shs372b ($100.05m) from Shs288b ($77.42m) in 2021 on the back of increased income on forex trading and investment in government securities.

The bulk of the earnings Shs403.5b ($108.48m) were generated by the Kenyan operations.</text>

    <text>Post Bank has retained the Shs15.1b it reported in profits for the period ended December 2022 as part of recapitalisation for the fully government owned bank.

Post Bank reported a 19.3 percent growth in net profit from Shs12.2b in 2021 to Shs15.1b.

The Post Bank, which had been a deposit-taking financial institution transformed into a commercial bank in December 2021.

The recapitalisation is part of Bank of Uganda‚Äôs requirement, in which, banks will be required to raise their capital requirement from Shs25b to Shs150b by June 2024.

In a post annual general meeting in Kampala, State Minister for Privatization and Investment Evelyn Anite, said Post Bank‚Äôs capital position remains strong, with paid up capital of Shs129b.

‚ÄúThis is above the interim limit of Shs120b set by Bank of Uganda. Post Bank is confident it will achieve the minimum Shs150b required by June 2024,‚Äù she said, noting that the bank reported a solid year-over-year growth, in which total assets grew by 21.3 percent from Shs745b in 2021 to Shs946. 6b.

Total income also increased from Shs144.5b to Shs159.2b, supported by a radical digital transformation journey that began in 2020.

Ms Anite said in order to provide cheap capital to the local borrowers in the country, government will continue to recapitalise Post Bank Uganda, Uganda Development Bank and Housing Finance Bank.

She also noted that reforms at Post Bank had enabled it to post stellar performance over the last three years.

‚ÄúWe want Post Bank to lend at 12 percent and Uganda Development Bank at 10 percent,‚Äù she said.

Mr Julius Kakeeto, the Post Bank managing director, said during the period, the bank experienced tremendous growth in digital transactions, which represented 60 percent of all bank transactions for the year, compared to about 10 percent in the last three years .

The increase, he said, had improved efficiency in a number of areas, especially in regard to improving customer experience.</text>

    <date>2023-04-12 06:12:02+00:00</date>
    <text>Fitch, a credit rating agency, has retained Stanbic Bank‚Äôs National Rating at AAA Stable, the highest possible on a national scale.

The agency also upgraded Stanbic‚Äôs Viability Rating, which measures credit worthiness to B+ from B due to improved capital buffers relative to its risk profile.

‚ÄúThe Viability Rating reflects the concentration of the bank‚Äôs operations in Uganda‚Äôs relatively weak operating environment as well as Stanbic‚Äôs leading market position, large capital buffers supported by internal capital generation, diversified and healthy revenue streams and good asset quality,‚Äù Fitch said.

Stanbic Bank is the anchor subsidiary of Stanbic Holdings, which is part of Standard Bank Group.

Fitch said the rating comes at a time when Stanbic has just reported strong financial performance for the year ended 2022 as the economy continues to recover from the aftereffects of Covid-19.

Fitch forecasts Uganda‚Äôs real gross domestic product to grow by 5.5 percent in 2023 as the economy to continues to be resilient to adverse global conditions and domestic climate risk events.

During 2022, the bank‚Äôs impaired loans ratio decreased to 2.9 percent from 4.6 percent, supported by significant write-offs and large recoveries.

Fitch noted that total loan loss allowances significantly increased to 127 percent due to expiry of repayment moratoriums on loans under pandemic-related payment consideration.

During the period, operating profit/risk-weighted assets stood at 7.7 percent, driven by a wide net interest margin (8.3 percent), high non-interest income and lower loan impairment charges.

Fitch noted that it expect profitability to remain high in 2023 due to an anticipation of persistence of high rates will. During the period, Fitch indicated Stanbic‚Äôs core capital ratio improved to a high 25.3 percent due to strong internal capital generation.

    <text>When I call him, his wife answers and tells me her husband cannot speak on the phone. I immediately become skeptical about scheduling a physical interview fearing that he was sick.

When I suggest to call later, his wife advises me to send a text instead. We continue communicating using texts until the day of the interview.

When he talks, I can hardly hear him because it is a whisper. So, I move closer which makes him look uncomfortable. This is when I decide to use my notebook for us to communicate, which he embraces happily.

‚ÄúThis is what I do in most cases. I have a notebook (pulls it out and starts to write). When I came here, I tried to speak but no one understood me until I wrote. But it takes a lot of time and some people cannot read Luganda or English,‚Äù he notes.

Benson Sande, 58, a resident of Kyebando in Kampala, suffers from cancer of the throat.

Symptoms

In 2014, Sande lost his voice (aphonia) and it sounded hoarse. Being a Born Again Christian and an elder in the church for more than 15 years, he thought he had just overstrained the voice while singing but the problem continued for weeks, months and years.

‚ÄúEach day, the voice sounded more hoarse and strained. I prayed for God‚Äôs healing but there was no answer. My voice only came out as a whisper which compelled me to go to the Ear Nose Throat (ENT) department at Mulago National Referral Hospital in mid-2018,‚Äù he says.

At first he was put on voice therapy and was advised not to talk for a week. This treatment continued for a month but nothing changed. The doctor then suggested closely examining the throat.

‚ÄúI saw the expression on the doctor‚Äôs face. It must have been horrible butthey did not want to scare me. I was then asked to do a biopsy and I was diagnosed with cancer of the throat,‚Äù he recalls.

Treatment

The news was not only saddening but also frightening for Sande. He was told he needed surgery to remove the voice box as soon as possible or start chemotherapy but it was hard for him to choose since he had seen many friends die while on treatment. He went home, believing in a miracle from God. He continued singing and serving in church and one day as he sang, he could not speak anymore and was having difficulty breathing.

‚ÄúI went to hospital by myself in February 2019 and the climbing lane towards the cancer institute felt so far away because of the escalating breathing problems. On arrival, an incision on my throat was immediately made and a tube was inserted to keep the airway from blocking completely while I waited for the main surgery to remove the voice box.‚Äù

Several tests were done and thereafter, the surgery in April. Fortunately, Sande did not pay for the surgery except for the tests. After the surgery, it was not necessary for him to take cancer medication because the cancer cells had not yet spread to other parts of the body.

Alternative

When the voice box was removed, it was replaced with a device (Blom Singer Voice Prosthesis) that would help him speak. This has to be removed and cleaned and replaced regularly.

About three times, Sande would go to hospital to have this device cleaned and changed until January this year when the doctor told him that the one he had cannot be put back because the muscles around the throat had grown bigger. Putting it back would be a great risk to his life.

‚ÄúI cannot have a new one because they are out of stock and they are usually imported from the USA at a cost of between $70 and $350 dollars (between Shs261,000 and Shs1.3m), depending on the brand. This is the reason I am not audible,‚Äù he says.

Complications

Throughout the interview, Sande keeps adjusting the neckline of his vest. When he laughs, his vest seems as though it is being blown by wind at the point where the collarbones meet. He can hold his nose and not gasp for breath because he breathes through a hole. The hole is located where the prosthetic voice box is meant to be. It is delicate and according to Sande, it should be kept away from water or dust.

‚ÄúDust and water will go directly into the lungs through the hole. It feels like water accidently getting into the nose, causing extreme pain. My commonest challenges are flu and cough which I suffer from almost every week and are uncomfortable. I still cough through the hole and flu causes the muscles of the throat to expand,‚Äù he says.

Another challenge is that he is allergic to perfume, coldness and dust. Through experience, he realised that some foods such as concentrated milk, bongo, and eshabwe also him cough. He, therefore, takes a lot of beetroot, soursop (kitafeli), vegetables and greens.

What are other throat cancer types?

‚óè Hypopharyngeal cancer: This cancer affects the part of your throat that is just above your esophagus and windpipe.

‚óè Nasopharyngeal cancer: This is a rare type of throat cancer. It affects the part of your throat that is just behind your nose.

‚óè Supraglottic cancer: This cancer starts in the upper part of your larynx. It can affect your epiglottis, the cartilage that keeps food from going into your windpipe. About 35 percent of all laryngeal cancers start in your supraglottis.

‚óè Glottic cancer: This is cancer in your vocal cords. Your vocal cords are in the middle part of your larynx. More than half of all laryngeal cancers start here.

‚óè Subglottic cancer: This cancer starts below your vocal cords in the lower part of your voice box. About five percent of all laryngeal cancers start here.</text>

When he started working at the hospital in 1979, he recalls children had fewer dental problems than adults but with time, there has been an overwhelming increase in the number of cases of dental decay. He attributes some of this to say cough syrups, which he says lead to teeth decay since many do not brush their teeth or rinse their mouth after taking them.

‚ÄúSweets are also more accessible and many people eat foods that contain a lot of sugar. These are the biggest contributors of holes in the teeth for both children and adults. The worst thing you can do to a child‚Äôs teeth is to give them something sweet before bed,‚Äù he says.

Teeth are our servants that we must take good care of or we will have to forego eating some nutritious foods because we cannot chew them. This can cause deficiency in some nutrients, leading to disease.

Avoid sweets

If you give your child sweets, juice, milk with sugar before bed, they will stop crying and sleep but whatever they take remains on their teeth and as we sleep, the salivary juices from the food or the drink stays on the teeth. Then, bacteria will start feeding on the sugar and digest it into acids.

The acids slowly soften the enamel and will cause holes with time. Unfortunately, parents bring the children to hospital when they are in a lot of pain and the teeth are damaged beyond repair. The best thing is to prevent such a thing from happening.

Using toothpaste that contains fluoride to brush your teeth is another way to prevent tooth decay and holes in the teeth, according to Dr Kigozi.

Beyond prevention

Once one‚Äôs teeth develop holes, it is too late to stop them and one must see a dentist as soon as possible. The dentist will carry out a physical examination or even an x-ray to determine the extent of damage, which will also determine the treatment.

If the damage is not extensive, sometimes, you do not have to do anything. I usually tell the patient that their tooth is about to develop a hole but if you reduce the intake of sweets and regularly brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste and use dental floss, then the hole may stop growing.

In case the damage is extensive, for young children, we paint their teeth with a chemical that is painless.

He says, ‚ÄúIt can be applied twice a year and can stop the hole from growing further. Silver diammine Fluoride (SDF) can stop tooth decay by hardening the tooth although it turns the tooth black.‚Äù

Another option that does not stain the teeth is called fluoride vanish. It also hardens the teeth but it is not as effective as the SDF. The least expensive and readily available option according to Dr Kigozi is toothpaste that contains fluoride. Even if the hole has started developing, it can be arrested and slowed down with regular, proper care of brushing twice a day with more emphasis to brushing before going to bed.

Dr Chapman remarks, ‚ÄúSometimes, the hole is too big and at this point the hole has to be cleaned and filled with a type of dental cement to restore the shape of the tooth. Although some types of cement can last up to 40 years, others only last five years. The larger the hole, the less likely it is for cement to last longer.‚Äù

Root canal

A hole in the tooth can cause discomfort and one is unable to sleep or chew because of the pain. Such a hole has reached the nerve and the treatment now becomes more complicated and expensive.

One may need a nerve treatment and may have to remove part of the nerve or the entire tooth in what is termed as a root canal treatment (RCT). The procedure may cost about Shs300,000 or more, depending on where you have it done. This, however, requires a dentist‚Äôs clinical judgment.

‚ÄúIf the hole is large enough, we may have to put a cover on the tooth called a crown done in two hospital visits to restore the tooth to the most natural function. This can cost between Shs600,000 and Shs1m depending on where you do it from. The crown is usually made from ceramic and can last up to 15 years,‚Äù says Dr Chapman.

There are incidences where the dentist cannot do anything except remove the tooth. ‚ÄúSometimes you have to tell the patient, ''bambi nga olabye. Erinnyo lino tulina okuligyamu kubanga ligenze wala nnyo! (I am sorry. We have to remove this tooth. It is badly damaged).''

When extracted, you can replace the tooth with a removable artificial tooth or one that is fixed and permanent.

Removable teeth are cheaper but one should always remove it before meals to avoid swallowing it accidentally.

Feeding and diet

Dr Kigozi warns against artificially sweetened foods and beverages. He says, ‚ÄúIf you take sweets, brush your teeth as soon as possible. Also, remember to limit your intake and the frequency because when you eat sweets, the acidic environment stays in your mouth for more than 30 minutes and the longer the acidic environment, the more time your teeth are likely to develop holes.‚Äù</text>

    <title>How to give your baby medicine</title>

    <date>2023-04-17 14:29:27+00:00</date>
    <text>When your baby is sick, you usually want to do whatever you can to make them feel better. However, it can be a struggle getting them to take medicine. Good hygiene is key. Ensure that you wash your hands before you touch the medicine. If it is a syrup, shake the bottle well before use unless stated otherwise on the label.

Carefully pour the medicine into the medicine cup or medicine spoon according to the dose on the label and give it to your baby but keep your baby upright when dispensing medication. Never dispense medicine while the baby is lying down because they may choke or easily vomit the medicine. Do not squirt medicine to the back of the throat. Instead, aim for the back of the cheek and slowly dispense the medicine, so your child can easily swallow.

Some medications cannot be given during meals or with particular foods. Remember to check with your child‚Äôs health care provider regarding any restrictions.

Tablets are not usually palatable for babies so they have to be crushed into a powder. When diluting medicine, avoid doing so in a large cup of liquid because you want to make sure they take all the medicine, which can be difficult in a large quantity.

For syrups, remember to use a paediatric measuring device such as a syringe or the measuring cap. Whether it is a syrup or a tablet, always read to know the right dosage and frequency to avoid under or overdosing the baby.

Ask your child's doctor, health care provider, or pharmacist if the medicine can be taken with foods and drinks. Some foods or drinks reduce the medicine's efficacy and babies might hate those foods.

Also read the labels to know whether your child is old enough to take that particular medicine. Some medications are not safe for babies/infants. If you have any questions, always check with your child‚Äôs health care provider for dosage, timing and appropriate medication.</text>

    <title>What can I use to treat my baby‚Äôs yellow eyes?</title>

    <text>My four-day-old baby has yellow eyes. I have been advised to take him out in the morning sun but I am afraid he will become too dark. Are there drugs I can give for this condition? Annita

Dear Annita,

Your baby is most likely suffering from what is referred to as neonatal jaundice, a harmless but common condition among newborns. It is usually caused by excessive accumulation of bilirubin, a blood breakdown product.

When in the womb, a baby has a lot of blood to trap the little oxygen there. After birth, babies start to breathe, hence not requiring to have lots of blood to trap the oxygen. The excess blood is then broken down, resulting in the production of excess bilirubin which the liver, because it is still immature, is unlikely to remove adequately from the body. The accumulated bilirubin will make the whites of eyes look yellow (jaundice).

This so-called physiological jaundice is one of the many causes of jaundice in the newborn but is usually harmless and clears on its own in two weeks since then, the liver is more effective at processing bilirubin. Premature babies and breastfed neonates are more likely to get this jaundice.

Much as jaundice could be physiological, it is important to take your child to a doctor, most importantly a paediatrician to rule out other causes such as rhesus group as well as breastmilk or breastfeeding problems. The doctor will also suggest ways of dealing with the baby.

In Uganda, phenobarbital, which improves the liver‚Äôs function may be given to the mother just before giving birth to reduce the likelihood of too much bilirubin formation.

Sometimes, mothers take their children out into the morning sunshine to reduce the jaundice. Usually, many mothers wrongly think that the sunshine may make the babies darker and avoid the sunshine even at the risk of complications from too much bilirubin in the body.</text>

    <title>Can one take Vitamin A while pregnant?</title>

    <text>I am in the early stages of pregnancy but I have read that I should not take anything that contains vitamin A, including fish oil, carrots and liver. How does Vitamin A affect a pregnant woman and unborn child? Meeri

Dear Meeri,

Fat, combined with carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, mineral salts and water taken in appropriate amounts is what we call a balanced diet and this is useful in maintaining good health in anybody and is most appropriate for a pregnant woman.

Pregnant women may find it difficult to have appropriate amounts of the balanced diet constituents, the reason they may require an intake of certain supplements to help them get what they may not be adequately getting from their usual diets.

Usually, supplements such as folic acid (to help prevent birth defects known as neural tube defects, including spina bifida) are given in a prenatal and antenatal clinic.

In Uganda, a number of people are taking supplements, including those made from the flesh or body of fish, to get one essential fat called omega-3. This supplement is safe to take during pregnancy.

Supplements made from a fish‚Äôs liver such as cod liver oil, however, are not safe to take during pregnancy since they contain a type of Vitamin A that if taken in excess can risk birth defects.

So, if one is pregnant or preparing to get pregnant, she should not eat liver or liver products such as liver p√¢t√©. They should also avoid using vitamin A skin products for acne since these contain high amounts of retinol, a type of Vitamin A that may lead to birth defects. Skin products can be absorbed into the body and may then reach the unborn child.</text>

    <title>Uganda‚Äôs debt likely to scale 50% GDP threshold, say AG</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/special-reports/uganda-s-debt-likely-to-scale-50-gdp-threshold-say-ag-4202016</url>

    <date>2023-04-17 08:48:24+00:00</date>
    <text>Uganda‚Äôs debt could soar to 53 percent this financial year, above the debt to gross domestic product (GDP) threshold, which threatens to upend an economy rebounding from the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic and a blip caused by the geo-political conflict in eastern Europe.

‚ÄúSuffice to note, debt to GDP ratios are projected to go 18 slightly above the 50 percent policy threshold by the end of FY2021/22 and to peak at 53.1 percent in FY2022/23,‚Äù the Auditor General observes in his latest report for the 2022 financial year.

The debt-to-GDP ratio is a measure that compares a country‚Äôs total debt and what it produces. The ratio reliably indicates a country‚Äôs ability to pay back its debt. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may make it more difficult for a country to pay both internal and external debt and may lead creditors to seek higher interest rates to compensate for financing risk due to likely default or unnecessary debt extension.

Though the IMF has recommended 50 percent as the point of safety, many developed countries have gone up to 200 percent. However, according to the IMF, developing countries are more prone to economic shocks and exchange rate risk, thus limiting them to 50 percent.

Experts are warning that un-sustained borrowing could snowball towards debt stress as the economy projected by the IMF to grow at 5.3 percent, hurtles towards the cliff.

The Auditor General, Mr John Muwanga, warned in the report: ‚ÄúPublic debt is continuously on the rise, a fact that is attributed to persistent budget deficits [mismatch of government revenue and expenditure], rollover of liquidity papers, bond switches, private placements, new borrowings for various development projects and foreign exchange loss arising from the depreciation of the shilling against stronger currencies.‚Äù

The figures from the Auditor General‚Äôs report show a consistent increase in the total debt as evidenced by an increase of 109 percent in the five years from FY2017/18, which stood at Shs41.4 trillion to Shs86.6 trillion as at June 30, 2022.

This has also greatly impacted on service delivery as a large chunk of what is collected by Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) is injected into payment of loan interests.

The Auditor General‚Äôs report reveals that during the previous financial year, 24.1 percent, an equivalent of Shs5.5 trillion of the revenue collected, was utilised towards interest payments and Shs1.4 trillion in principal debt repayment, representing 6 percent of the domestic revenue collected.

About 30.1 percent, which is worth Shs6.9 trillion of the total revenue collected, was used to service the debt, leaving only 69.9 percent worth Shs15.93 trillion available for funding other critical government expenditures. This left a paltry amount available for service delivery, which constitutes 30.89 percent of the total revised budget of Shs51.56 trillion implying that 69.1 percent was financed by grants and loans.

An economist, Abubakar Mayanja, argued that for an economy to rebound from a tailspin, investment is key to create a stimulus.

But he fears that too much debt may lead to debt distress and this may cripple investment in the most productive sectors of the economy.

‚ÄúWhen you look at the budget of Uganda, it has been growing on nominal terms and so the demands on government to meet its own obligation to meet its recurrent expenditure, payment of salaries, if you add pressure of debt service, it becomes difficult to fiscally operate,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúSo, the root cause of domestic borrowing is the structural fiscal deficit where government always has a higher expenditure than the revenue it generates from taxation and it has been increasing so the demands of government in turns of its needs for money then it goes into the market to borrow.‚Äù

Fitch ratings last month revised the outlook on Uganda‚Äôs long-term foreign currency issuer defaulting rate (IDR) from stable to negative. The revision of the outlook to negative reflects heightened fiscal and external financing and liquidity pressures, partly related to reduced availability of concessional external financing, tighter domestic and external financing conditions, and large twin budget and current account deficits (CAD).

These pressures are evident in declining foreign exchange reserves, a scheduled increase in debt service payments, rising government interest costs, a less favourable public debt structure in some respects and a rising net external debt-to-GDP ratio.

Fitch offers sovereign credit ratings that describe each nation‚Äôs ability to meet its debt obligations and sovereign credit ratings are available to investors to help give them insight into the level of risk associated with investing in a particular country.

A confluence of events could further complicate recovery as the acting Director for Budget at the Finance ministry, Mr Ishamael Magona, warned that the country only has about Shs24 trillion out of the total budget of Shs51.56 trillion for this financial year.

As a result of Uganda‚Äôs negative ratings, it could borrow at higher interest rates if it seeks the Eurobond as Kenya has done in the past. A Eurobond is a bond issued offshore by governments or corporates denominated in a currency other than that of the issuer‚Äôs country and are usually long-term debt instruments.

But the deputy Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Patrick Ocailap, told the Monitor that debt was manageable and government will not seek a Eurobond.

‚ÄúYes, debt has been growing over the years. As of June last year, I think the numbers that I have debt-to-GDP ratio, in nominal terms June 30 last year, was 48 percent, just two points below the 50 percent threshold, which is a big achievement,‚Äù he said.

He, however, argued that countries ought to be rational in contracting debt and it should be spent across the productive sectors of the economy.

‚ÄúThe expansion of debt should be seriously curtailed. Our policy stand has been very clear. Most of the world economies adjusted to the effects of inflation, which are supply chain distortions as a result of covid and supply shocks the world realised. As a result of subdued aggregate demand, most Central banks as their cup of tea reacted by putting in place monetary policies to increase the level of interest rates to curb inflationary levels in the economy,‚Äù Mr Ocailap said.

To deal with inflation, the Central Bank adjusted the Central Bank Rate (CBR) in Uganda from 6 percent in 2022 to 10 percent currently. One of the fiscal measures that the government undertook, according to Mr Ocailap, was to improve efficiency in tax collection and austerity measures that halted wastage on travel abroad and workshops, among others.

Mr Ocailap estimates that these austerity measures will result in savings worth Shs242 billion, which shall be repurposed to productive areas such as the Parish Development Model, agro-processing, Naads, and community roads to move produce from farms to markets.

Recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSAs) reports by the Finance and the IMF show that Uganda‚Äôs debt is sustainable but at moderate risk of debt distress in the medium and long term.

However, an economist at the Economic Policy Research Centre (EPRC), Ms Linda Nakato, warned that Uganda could be caught up in a ‚Äúpublic debt safety trap‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is [DSA] not as comprehensive as it should be in order for us to get a true position of how we are performing because there are several different factors that influence our debt sustainability position and hence our decision to borrow, but why we felt that this may give a false sense of security is that the fact it has a limited scope because if we are to go into the different factors based on the monetary and the macro-economic factors, based on governance, we have a lot of corruption issues, then we have a bigger challenge as in regards to public debt to guard us from falling into distress,‚Äù Ms Nakato said.

Countries are caught up in a safety trap when a favourable debt position based solely on DSA results increases their borrowing appetite and carefree fiscal behaviour, especially when the public debt is still below the set national or international debt limit. This is primarily fuelled by the ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù safety due to more fiscal headroom to borrow, especially for countries overly relying on DSA results to assess debt policy sustainability and make borrowing decisions.

In her view, getting out of the public debt safety trap requires a holistic view of debt sustainability. This includes understanding the external and internal macroeconomic environment and its relationship with debt sustainability because sound debt management is more effective when linked to a credible macroeconomic framework that promotes stability.

Ms Nakato said sound and good fiscal management reduces riskier debt portfolios and reduces vulnerability to shocks and strengthens the link between budgetary or debt management and monetary policy, especially with the noticeable increase in domestic debt and inflation. She added that reducing corruption, promoting fiscal transparency, rewarding accountability and enforcing fiscal rules are key in sustaining borrowing.

The Auditor General also disclosed in the statement of financial performance that domestic arrears exponentially rose from Shs4.65 trillion in 2021, to Shs7.55 trillion in 2022 constituting a 62 percent increase.

Usually, the borrowing rates in the domestic market are higher compared to International Development Association (IDA) concessional terms that offer low interest rates.

Mr Mayanja said domestic borrowing is dictated by the prevailing conditions in the global markets.

‚ÄúFor example, the US has increased interest rates to control inflation so the cost of borrowing is a bit higher and also there is a lot of fatigue from the countries we traditionally borrowed from, which also had a crisis of their own during the pandemic, and so the government naturally turned to the domestic market,‚Äù he said.

He added that the perils of domestic borrowing ‚Äúcreates a scenario where the private sector from which government generates taxes to pay its debt doesn‚Äôt have the opportunity to grow because the capital is more expensive because government is borrowing this money at a high rate.‚Äù

As a result, one of the structural problems that arises is that most of the savings that should have gone towards long-term investment end up in short-term government instruments and that limits the expansion of the economy.

Mr Ocailap said they have cut back on borrowing this financial year and ‚Äúdecided that the portion we want to borrow this year from the domestic market to switch to an international market and get relatively cheaper borrowing.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe watch international markets. That switch will give us some reprieve on domestic borrowing.‚Äô

He further said there are both monetary and fiscal policy measures that have been enforced but policy wonks have resisted the temptation of subsidies.

‚ÄúWe stood our grounds and said no [to subsidies]. You are not supposed to play to the gallery. We elected the option by doing cautious by cutting back on expenditure and improving our efficiency in revenue collection in support of the monetary policy side, where interest rates were increasing. We are vindicated, inflation is back to single digit, interest rates in domestic markets should be abating, the commodity prices have also responded positively and our exchange rate has been stable,‚Äù he said.

The tax body is seeking to roll out a raft of tax reform proposals contained in six recently-tabled bills in the August House. But there are fears that these taxes could disincentivise the few shouldering the tax burden and in Mayanja‚Äôs view is an attempt to ‚Äúkill the goose that lays the golden egg‚Äù.

The Auditor General also listed a number of contracts where government had lost funds worth billions of shillings as a result of the cancellation of the contracts and commissions, which accrued as a result of unspent funds meant to be spent on these projects.

For instance, the contract for the construction of the Muzizi Hydropower Dam was cancelled barely after government had paid a total of Shs3.967 billion in commission fees to the German Development Bank (KFW).

‚ÄúI noted that from the date of execution of the said loan to the cancellation, the government had paid to the KFW a total of Shs3.967 billion in commission fees for unutilised funds. This in effect caused a financial loss to the government the said amount as there was no benefit for the money. The failure to absorb the funds therefore can be categorised as a nugatory expense,‚Äù reads the report.

In a July 14, 2022 letter, the KFW indicated that the total amount payable on the loan would be ‚Ç¨1,171,875 (equivalent to Shs4.657 billion) as cancellation and commitment fees.

The audit noted that the initial agreement entered into by the government and the KFW had a draw-down period of December 30, 2021. Following the lapse of the draw-down period, the government successfully secured a renewal of the facility.

The Auditor General said this anomaly amounts to an unnecessary payment which could have been avoided either by allowing the facility to lapse or not renewing it before cancellation.

There is no evidence that the minister sought the advice of the Attorney General before the cancellation process was undertaken, the report partly reads.

A review of the status reports provided to the Finance ministry by Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) on the execution of the project revealed that funds totalling Shs2.695 billion had been doled towards the compensation of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and acquisition of land.

The report also revealed that billions of shillings have been doled out in commissions as a result of unspent funds for the construction of the Kampala-Jinja Expressway and Tororo-Gulu Railway line.

    <title>Seven-year-old twins become breadwinners</title>

    <text>Bare-chested with their potbellies greeting the eyes of any visitor who enters the grass-thatched hut they call home, seven-year-old Aaron Opio and Doreen Acen are not merely children but breadwinners for themselves.

What they call their place of abode, has the power to invite tears, it is a doorless house with barely any beddings.

This is where the twins find comfort to rest when dusk falls, they say, most often on empty stomachs.

A tattered piece of dirty bedsheet, half piece of parched mattress and a broken green basin is all they own, in Acyekitoyo Village, Kaga Parish, Ochero Sub-county.

Opio and Acen were sired by an unknown father with their mother, who is mentally ill, and identified as Christine Asege.

Their mother‚Äôs daily way of life is that of giggling around Akampala Landing Site in Ochero Sub-county on the shores of Lake Kyoga.

The twins also have a nine-year-old brother, Denis Eriku, whose father is unknown.

To make ends meet, Eriku runs errands around the village; at times herding animals for a day‚Äôs pay of Shs1,000. That is the money Opio and Acen patiently wait for at the end of the day to have a meal,

‚ÄúSince yesterday, we have not had any meal, we have been looking at the footpath that leads back to the house we call home, for our brother to bring something but in vain. Perhaps he has gone herding. I am hungry, and the nights can be cold on an empty stomach,‚Äù Acen says in Kumam, her mother tongue.

The little twin girl (Acen) says at times they take days without seeing their mother. ‚ÄúShe was here five days ago with a piece of fish, perhaps from the landing site,‚Äù she says, as she stares at the narrow road for a possible return of their brother Eriku.

Ms Joyce Alao, who lives about two kilometres away from the home of these children, says all of Ms Asege‚Äôs immediate relatives are dead, so her children find themselves in ‚Äòsolitary confinement‚Äô with no close folks to turn to apart from well-wishers.

On a good day, when there are leftovers from the meal served at the nearby community school, the custodians usher the children in for a day‚Äôs bite. That gesture is, however, rare.

‚ÄúAs a village mate, I don‚Äôt know when I last saw their mother. I no longer hear her giggle, because that is the sign that signals her presence,‚Äù Ms Alao says.

The 60-year-old Alao says the village has many destitute children, whose biological parents are unknown.

‚ÄúPeople come here from different parts of Teso to fish. With the nature and character of people, they sire children who are left to the fate of nature,‚Äù she explains.

Ms Alao says the situation has worsened due to economic hardship.

‚ÄúAs a village, we have longed to know the father of these children but it has not been possible, nor does the mother know. We believe someone slept with her in the dead of the night, left her pregnant, and the resultant effect are the suffering children,‚Äù she told this publication.

According to Opio, some well-wishers had enrolled them to school for Primary One but they opted out due to lack of food.

‚ÄúAt the time when people were busy harvesting potatoes, we would move to homes to help peel, then they would give us a basin full of fresh potatoes,‚Äù Opio adds.

‚ÄúMummy is not there for us‚Äù, Opio says, as he laughs at a lake bird flapping its wings over their mud and wattle grass-thatched hut. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have clothes, all we have is what we are currently putting on,‚Äù he adds.

Leaders say

Mr Victor Rex Ekesu, the chairperson for Kaberamaido District local government, says the matter of child-headed families has become a common trajectory in Ngora and Soroti because of different circumstances, including death of parents and economic conditions.

As result, in such situations, the elder child takes responsibility of the other siblings.

Mr Ekesu says leaders have tried to talk to relatives to take responsibility, through the social support system which exists within the clan system.

‚ÄúThe proportion of such child-headed families within the district, ranges between, one to two percent. You find a girl of 16 years being the breadwinner, and helping the other little siblings sail through the difficulties of life,‚Äù he adds.

Mr Ekesu adds that at district level, the community based service have interventions, and once in a while they have helped children mitigate the social challenges.</text>

    <title>Kiira EV 12 years later: Arrested development?</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/special-reports/kiira-ev-12-years-later-arrested-development--4198984</url>

    <text>Why is he coming out now? What does he want? Who is behind him? Those were some of the questions posed when Mr Jeremy Steven Ntambi, 39, came out of obscurity on June 29, 2020, on Twitter to, as he put it, ‚Äúset the record straight.‚Äù

He was addressing himself to Kiira EV‚Äîthat petit green electric vehicle that went down in the annals as the first such car to be made in Uganda 12 years ago.

When President Museveni rode in it while visiting Makerere University in November 2011, Kiira EV captured the imagination of the international media. After a messy general election reached a crescendo a few months earlier, this was welcome positive coverage for the Museveni administration. The UK Guardian screamed with the headline: ‚ÄúUganda‚Äôs first electric car proves the potential of Africa‚Äôs universities.‚Äù

Subsequently, an idea was considered to start ‚Äúproducing cars‚Äù in Uganda under the enterprise, Kiira Motors Corporation (KMC). The corporation was first housed out of Makerere University under the Presidential Initiative for Science and Technology Innovations. It then moved to Uganda Development Corporation, the government‚Äôs development arm under the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives.

Disagreements, however, supervened and KMC moved to the Ministry of Science and Technology, where it is reinforced by the Uganda People‚Äôs Defence Forces‚Äô (UPDF) commercial arm‚ÄîNational Enterprise Corporation.

Kiira EV was hitherto known as Makerere EV, but according to accounts President Museveni recommended an indigenous name‚ÄîKiira; the other name of the River Nile.

Mr Ntambi‚Äôs claims attracted the odd media interview here and there. KMC, now led by his former supervisors at Makerere University‚Äôs College of Engineering, Design Art and Technology (CEDAT), strongly rebutted his claims. It threatened legal action for good measure.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be mistaken as having an agenda to bring the current efforts of Kiira Motors down,‚Äù Mr Ntambi affirmed during a nearly four-hour-long interview with Saturday Monitor, adding, ‚ÄúI just want[ed] to set the record straight.‚Äù

In early 2019, Mr Ntambi quit his job as the engineering operations manager at KCCA to focus on his private venture dealing in technology-based solutions. With his double degree in economics and international trade from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Italy, and University of Warsaw in Poland, respectively, he said he had a lot to do‚Äîespecially focusing on models-based technology solutions.

It is as a result of this passion for technology, Mr Ntambi asserted, that he cannot let go of his erstwhile association with Uganda‚Äôs first electric hybrid vehicle, aka Kiira EV. He claimed the idea was originally his and later had input from other students. Two are living a quiet life in Kampala and the other moved to Ireland for greener pastures.

He who alleges‚Ä¶

So what did Ntambi want? He maintained he just wanted to let the world know. Also for that reason, contrary to suggestions from friends, remained opposed to the idea of seeking court redress. Why was he coming out then?

He said when he was initially thrown off the project in 2011, after it had eventually taken off following President Museveni‚Äôs financial support, he was pained but agreed to stand aside ‚Äúhoping the vision we set out with would be translated into something; I was wrong.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI just want the country to see, for people to start asking the right questions since its taxpayers‚Äô money being played around with. Some people think I want money or I am being used; don‚Äôt they think I could have tried to cut a deal of sorts not to come out at all?‚Äù

The car idea he narrated was borne out of the Power Electronics course unit during his Third Year in 2007. This was part of the four-year Electrical Engineering degree course. He was among the three students taking the course unit taught by Dr Tom Wanyama, who would exit Makerere for greener pastures in Canada later that year.

In a statement responding to media inquiries issued on July 3, 2020, KMC executives clarified that ‚ÄúNtambi didn‚Äôt at any one time develop Kiira Motors concepts and at no one time was he involved in Kiira Motors Corporation.‚Äù

The company, however, loosely acknowledged that he was involved in the development of the Kiira EV. Even then, the company offered that Mr Ntambi was involved in the development of the vehicle as a students-led project under CEDAT.

It added that after completing his undergraduate, he immediately went away to pursue his Masters and then PhD.

The genesis to the current entanglement, KMC added, started on June 22, 2020, when Mr Ntambi presented a system for public transport payments to a private company. He was reportedly referred to KMC, and on June 23, 2020, met the Kiira Motors team with an idea to provide a public transport payment system. KMC said the idea was well received and Mr Ntambi was asked to submit a proposal and a formal letter of intent with relevant documentation.

During our interview, Mr Ntambi denied this account of events. He said he approached Victoria Motors and made a presentation on a possible business proposal on a system for public transport payments, which they bought. He further suggested that since they have a vehicle leasing contract with KMC, he pitches for them as well ‚Äúbecause they likely needed the product more.‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven my background with Kiira Motors, I was against the idea, but for the sake of securing my business with Victoria Motors, I agreed to meet and present to them (Kiira),‚Äù he clarified, adding, ‚ÄúIt is true they too liked the idea ‚Ä¶ my dealing was with Victoria Motors, not Kiira Motors.‚Äù

While in their defence KMC has tried hard to discount Mr Ntambi‚Äôs involvement in the development of Kiira EV, available records and interviews with multiple individuals familiar with the project indicate otherwise.

Time reveals, relives

In January 2009, The New Vision published an article titled ‚ÄúNtambi leads Makerere team to next generation car.‚Äù It detailed the car project in its early stages, and quoted then Makerere University Chancellor, Prof Mondo Kagonyera, waxing lyrical about both Mr Ntambi and the invention.

Mr Jeremy Steven Ntambi

According to the article, Mr Ntambi and a group of fellow students who graduated that same year, fantasised of setting up a $1.7m (Shs6.3b) general transportation research centre and told dreams of Uganda being able to produce special vehicles.

This dream, Mr Ntambi said and KMC admitted, started with the students taking part in the Vehicle Design Summit (VDS) organised by the US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology. VDS was a students‚Äô innovative research project aimed at applying contemporary technologies to develop sustainable transportation solutions for Uganda and Africa.

Mr Ntambi narrated that during his Third Year‚Äîand during discussions with Dr Wanyama‚Äîthey explored several projects, some of which less interested him.

In 2007, while he was exploring the idea of remote controlling cars as part of the Power Electronics course unit, Dr Wanyama introduced Mr Ntambi to one of the VDS directors. This led to him attending the first students meeting in Leuven, Belgium, in November 2007.

VDS brought together students from some 35 research universities around the world, advised by industrial bigwigs like General Motors, with the idea of designing and building different components of a car‚ÄîVision 200. Makerere University was the only participating institution from Africa.

‚ÄúOne of the things that occurred to me when I attended the summit was thinking: ‚Äòwhat can we do as Makerere?‚Äô In line with what the meeting was about, I got the idea of our university building a plug-in series (engine) for hybrid electric cars,‚Äù he recalled.

Upon return, Mr Ntambi rallied a team of three other students‚Äîone classmate and two from other courses, civil engineering and Information Technology. These, Mr Ntambi said, ‚Äúwould add value to the plug-in series engine.‚Äù

The team, including Mr Ntambi, attended a follow-up meeting in January 2008, in Milan, Italy, to advance discussions on the component they were building. The New Vision documented the students‚Äô trip in an article published on January 15 that year, with Mr Ntambi mentioned as the team leader.

When they returned, he moulded the project work into his Fourth Year thesis as a prelude to finishing the course and graduating.

‚ÄúFor me, it was not just about graduation; it was about how to make our idea work,‚Äù he noted.

Prof Barnabas Nawangwe, then principal of the college, allocated them working space, and the project team was expanded to 11 members of mainly continuing students who would take it forward after Mr Ntambi‚Äôs group had graduated.

A follow-up/final VDS meeting dubbed the design summit, took place in June 2008 in Turin, one of Italy‚Äôs industrial cities. Only six members of the team travelled since it was mostly a self-funded trip.

In Turin, their idea was fine-tuned and added to the larger student car project. This being the final leg, Mr Ntambi said they invited Dr Sandy TickodrI Togboa. He had taken over supervision of the project from Dr Wanyama.

Eventually, the ideas from the different students led to the assembling and showcasing of a six-passenger, hybrid, 100 miles per gallon (mpg)‚Äî used to show how far your car is able to travel for every gallon (or 4.55 litres) of fuel it uses‚Äîand, world prototype was thus built.

Seeing the seed sprout

‚ÄúIt was a moment that made us feel proud as Makerereans and Ugandans being the only African group present,‚Äù Mr Ntambi reminisced his account corroborated by another student who participated but requested anonymity owing to his current status.

Mr Ntambi added: ‚ÄúWhat hurts me most is after MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] funded part of our trips and some of the things we eventually did. They had wanted us to sign off our work to them, which I refused. If I did so, I was going to betray not just Makerere but Uganda.‚Äù

He immediately emailed Prof Nawangwe, informing him of the proposal by MIT and further asked about the university‚Äôs policy on intellectual property.

In the email, Mr Ntambi noted that MIT had actually coaxed one of their colleagues to sign away the project but it was not too late to reverse the order.

He wrote: ‚ÄúWe have insisted that all the work that was done by the Ugandan team is intellectual property of Makerere, and none of us is willing. We were, however, not sure if there is an intellectual property policy at the university to protect our work.‚Äù

In an interview with Saturday Monitor, Prof Nawangwe, now the university vice chancellor, acknowledged that upon Dr Wanyama‚Äôs exit, he tapped Prof Tickodri as supervisor of the project. This was at the behest of the students with whom they travelled to Italy ‚Äúwhere they did their part successfully; showcased their part and upon return, they felt they could build their car here.‚Äù

Prof Nawangwe added: ‚ÄúIt is true Jeremy [Ntambi] led the team to Italy and the idea was conceived under the mentorship of Prof Tickodri. It was also at a time when Jeremy was in his final year, and after his graduation, he left Makerere and went away for his Masters and later PhD.‚Äù

Prof Nawange proceeded to note: ‚ÄúIt is true Jeremy was involved in the conception of the idea of building a car, but the development of the car happened when he had left.‚Äù

The idea materialised eventually during the Italy excursion while the students and Prof Tickodri were visiting the automobile giant Fiat‚Äôs old factory in Turin after the main design event.

‚ÄúWe told Prof Tickodri that given what we had seen and been exposed to, we could do the same upon returning home‚Äîa spinoff of sorts,‚Äù Mr Ntambi told Saturday Monitor.

Upon return from Italy, Mr Ntambi modelled the design of the car component into his Fourth Year thesis titled ‚ÄúVehicle Design Summit‚Äôs Vision 200‚ÄîDesign of the Power Electronics‚Äîfocused on design and development of the converter for the auxiliary power unit (APU) and its control strategy.‚Äù He requested Prof Tickodri to supervise the project.

‚ÄúIt was very hard. After the exit of Dr Wanyama, there was no one else competent enough to supervise my thesis. Prof Nawangwe, who was passionate about it, was from an architecture background and Prof Tickodri, who was the closest competent person, was into mathematics and IT. But to his credit, he had been involved in other ambitious projects like the academic records management system,‚Äù Mr Ntambi said. ‚ÄúBut he was too busy. He agreed to my request to supervise me, but brought in Paul Isaac Musasizi, who was an assistant lecturer at the time, to assist him.‚Äù

Moving parts

KMC in its defence said Mr Ntambi requested Mr Musasizi, who is now the chief executive of the company, to supervise his thesis. The latter in turn brought in Prof Tickodri. Mr Ntambi said from the beginning, he did not get along well with Mr Musasizi, who felt his thesis was ‚Äútoo ambitious.‚Äù Mr Ntambi further said more than once Mr Musasizi talked him into changing the subject if he wanted to graduate in time.

‚ÄúToday, he is the same person who is leading the supposed car production,‚Äù Mr Ntambi said.

‚ÄúI refused to change my thesis, and in fact, eventually we had to get external validators to double check my work leading to my graduation.‚Äù

Pending graduation in January 2009, and picking up on discussions with Prof Tickodri in Italy, Mr Ntambi said the team threw around the idea of the Centre for Research in Transport Technologies (CRTT). The intention was to put to effective use skills obtained from the involvement of students in the Vision 200.

Ntambi said he generated a concept for the CRTT, something he first discussed in person with one of the core members he started out with in early 2008, on the car project.

‚ÄúI remember a team member asking me why I had shared the brief. He felt that I was giving away too much,‚Äù Mr Ntambi revealed. ‚ÄúA lot happened in between. I tried pitching the same to several people whom I wanted to connect me to meet the President, but it did not happen quickly.‚Äù

Then came graduation and since none of the four students had been retained as teaching assistants by the university, they all scattered. Nonetheless, they remained optimistic the project was in the good hands of the continuing students they co-opted. Mr Ntambi secured a job at Vision Group and later a scholarship for a Master‚Äôs degree abroad.

Meanwhile, Makerere University pitched the idea of CRTT to the President as one of the 11 innovations they were working on back in 2011. The Makerere EV was assembled. President Museveni visited, liked the car, and along came a war chest. The rest is history. CRTT metamorphosed into KMC.

Upon return from studies abroad in mid-2011, Mr Ntambi attempted to rejoin the group. After a lot of back-and-forth, he ran into a brick wall.

In an August 11, 2011 e-mail to Prof Tickodri, Mr Ntambi wrote that it ‚Äúis indeed true that Paul [Musasizi] and I have very different working styles and, therefore, will not be able to work together on the project. This is partially due to the fact that Paul finds me rather very ambitious while he is more conservative. However, this project development is driven by wild ambition to achieve things that have not been achieved before.‚Äù

KMC indicated that Mr Ntambi, upon return ‚Äúwith funding secured and work progressing, suddenly sent an email that the current team led by Mr Musasizi should leave and he takes over.‚Äù The demand, it added, was baseless ‚Äúas he had no formal engagement either as a student or staff of Makerere University. He then disappeared again. It was later discovered that he had gone to pursue a PhD out of the country.‚Äù

Mr Ntambi said: ‚ÄúThat I was no longer wanted on a project I literally conceived was a nightmare. I tried to speak out, but then again, Kiira EV was a hot thing at the time. The journalists I talked to thought I was making this up. And who was going to believe me against the professors, anyway. I felt betrayed; left with a bitter taste.‚Äù

Stasis

There are numerous records, documents and email trails from as far back as 2007 to corroborate Mr Ntambi‚Äôs claims. Whether his speaking out now helps his cause or not is unclear, what is not in doubt is that billions of taxpayers‚Äô money have been sunk into KMC to lead Uganda into tomorrow‚Äôs vision of mass production of electric cars for which there is little to show other than the occasional razzmatazz of assembled shiny cars put on display.

KMC bought 518 hectares of land contiguous with the Jinja Industrial Park to establish a car production plant whose construction President Museveni commissioned in August 2021. The President further directed the Ministry of Finance to look around for Shs141b to complete the plant whose completion was expected by January 2022.

Phase one of the plant was designed for production of up to 22 vehicles (buses, trucks and pick-ups) a day/ 5,000 vehicles a year. However, little has been said about production of the much-vaunted electric cars, the future of automobiles, 12 years later and with billions of shillings spent.

    <title>My Ebola Story: The life of an Ebola ward cleaner</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/special-reports/my-ebola-story-the-life-of-an-ebola-ward-cleaner-4198864</url>

    <date>2023-04-14 09:23:32+00:00</date>
    <text>When the number of Ebola cases rose in October and the Ebola treatment unit at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital got full, the Ministry of Health made a proposal to set up a new treatment centre which would accommodate a big number of patients. The new centre would be at Kaweeri. Doctors were deployed to Mubende and vacancies for various positions were advertised through the district service commission.

Among the applicants for the jobs was Francis Ssempijja, a 32-year-old resident of Nkanaga in Mubende Municipality. He looked at this as an opportunity to earn money since his financial status was not good due to the lockdown that had been imposed on the district. He also had his pregnant wife to think about.

‚ÄúI am a painter. When our boss saw that there was a lockdown and cases were on the rise, he decided to suspend all the work thinking that we might infect each other, since everyone was coming from a different place. I remained with no job yet I had a wife who was seven months pregnant and needed much care,‚Äù he said.

At the time, Ssempijja was volunteering at the Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) where he was trained in safe and dignified burial (SDB) management. While at URCS, he carried out burials for two people. It is here that he heard about M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) advertising jobs for hygienists to work in the new Kaweeri Ebola treatment centre.

‚ÄúI went and applied for the job because I realised my wife wasn‚Äôt comfortable with the kind of work I was doing at URCS of burying dead bodies. She fears dead bodies a lot so whenever I came back home, she would feel nervous yet she was in a sensitive condition. I might have lost my family if I insisted on working for Red Cross,‚Äù he says.

He did the interviews, passed and started working on October 26.

‚ÄúWe were all working as hygienists but it consisted of doing different things including cleaning outside, where the doctors work from, the changing area and their resting corner, washing the clothes they [hygienists and doctors] used to wear, washing the scrubs and boots, transporting oxygen from the oxygen plant to the treatment wards, cleaning the toilets, mixing chlorine used for washing and disinfection and other kinds of work. However the rosters were changed every after two weeks,‚Äù he narrates.

Ssempijja says he was majorly an internal hygienist following the doctors‚Äô request to be one of the eight people who would work inside the treatment wards because he was friendly and easy-going.

He adds that many of the patients were scared. They were working with a psychosocial team but in many cases, the team always was scared of entering the rooms to speak to the patients. So sometimes the hygienists found themselves having to do their work of speaking and providing counsel to the sick.

Ssempijja recalls one of the times when he thought that he had contracted the disease. Sometimes when the hygienists went to clean the ward, patients would ask them for help since they were not allowed to have caretakers. The patients would ask for a bucket to vomit in. Once, as Ssempijja was trying to get the bucket to a patient, they accidentally vomited on him.

He got scared thinking that he was infected.

‚ÄúThe patients would apologise but we understood. To work inside the treatment wards, you had to have a big caring heart and be understanding, depending on the condition of the patients; they didn‚Äôt need people shouting at them,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúThat situation wasn‚Äôt easy to adapt to. Even when the patient vomits on you, you have nothing to do other than giving that patient counselling. The patient would feel that he/she has done something wrong and feel awful because of his/her actions so it was our responsibility to calm them down and get out of the room to go and change,‚Äù he adds.

And sometimes as soon as they had changed into fresh coveralls, they would be called into another ward with a patient in critical condition who has vomited blood, which they had to clean up.

‚ÄúLiving in such a situation was so scary and very hard to adapt to. What surprised me was that I didn‚Äôt fear the dead bodies. It was the vomit, blood, diarrhoea and urine which was scary as we were told that those were so deadly if you get in contact with them. You would get scared wondering if maybe your glove had got a hole in it and the waste passed through,‚Äù Ssempijja says.

‚ÄúHowever, at a certain point, we adjusted to this because the psychosocial team was there to give us support through counselling. Sometimes, I would counsel colleagues who were scared,‚Äù he adds.

He says his worst moment was when a military veteran from Kibalinga died. The two had become friends and the veteran called him his son.

‚ÄúWe used to talk because I was among the people who received him from the ambulance and took him to the ward where he had to receive treatment. I asked to call him Kazeeyi since he was old,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúKazeeyi had become my friend for the three days he spent in the ward but what still hurts and scares me is the day he passed on. He was on oxygen but he could talk. He told me that he couldn‚Äôt breathe properly; at that time the oxygen was over from the cylinder,‚Äù Ssempijja recalls.

‚ÄúI made an alert for us to get more oxygen cylinders. The minute the cylinder arrived in the ward, Kazeeyi held my hand tightly. He threw his legs and other arm in the air. I tried to bring him back, but he was so strong. He died while holding my hand and staring at me. The pain he went through as he was dying touched my heart and up to today, I still see him in my dreams,‚Äù Ssempijja recounts.

After the old man died, Ssempijja was asked to work on his body but he couldn‚Äôt. He walked out of the room crying. He almost collapsed in the ward because he couldn‚Äôt feel his legs; he was helped and carried out.

‚ÄúIt took me time before I could enter the treatment wards. I told my bosses that what had happened scared me,‚Äù he recalls.

Ssempijja adds that a few days later, he was assigned to handle a body in a different ward, however, he was still dealing with the trauma of Kazeeyi‚Äôs death and was unable to do the task.

One of his bosses ended up handling the body.

He says the memory of Kazeeyi lying on his bed lingers in his mind. The psychosocial team offered him support and eventually, he returned to work. It, however, took a long time for him to deal with the trauma.

Ssempijja also recounts a moment when a patient named Gloria kept pleading with them to help her to end her life because of the difficulties she was going through.

‚ÄúGloria had reached a time when she wanted to take an overdose of medicine to end her life because of the situation and life challenges she was going through. She was vomiting blood every five minutes. We did not think she would survive but after she shared her problems with us and through my counselling, she listened and is still alive,‚Äù he says, clearly one of the moments he is proud of.

There were other challenges Ssempijja got while working at the treatment unit, including getting nightmares. Another challenge was carrying patients. Some patients were heavy and yet he and three others were the only people who could carry the sick from the ambulance onto a stretcher and into the ward.

He recalls a scenario when a patient tore his coverall as they were carrying her from an ambulance to a stretcher. He told his colleagues to put her down and immediately made an alert for the team to send someone else since he couldn‚Äôt enter the room while exposed.

‚ÄúI got scared thinking this time I had contracted the disease. Even when I went to change, I felt like I already had Ebola and the following day I felt sick. Maybe it was just the fear I had got thinking I had been infected,‚Äù he says.</text>

    <title>My Ebola story: Nampenjja witnessed 15 succumb to disease</title>

    <date>2023-04-13 14:07:23+00:00</date>
    <text>The battle with Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), especially in the patient ward, was a challenging life experience for Ms Annet Nampenjja.

Ms Nampenjja, a resident of Ngabano village in Madudu Sub-county, was the first patient to be admitted to the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) at Mubende General Hospital when the disease outbreak was declared on September 20, 2022, in the district.

She had been admitted to the general patient ward at Mubende Hospital but she became the first patient to be transferred to the Ebola isolation facility after the tests confirmed that she was positive for Ebola.

While most Ebola recovery cases at the treatment unit were discharged with two to three weeks, Ms Nampenjja spent five weeks at the facility.

Ms Nampenjja, like several others, has one common likely facility where she believes she came into contact with the disease.

She had earlier nursed her three-year-old son at St Florence Clinic in Ngabano Village, Madudu Sub-county in Mubende District.

‚ÄúThe child had severe malaria when we rushed her to the clinic. Three days after we got discharged, the three-year-old was back at the clinic. This time, the boy was vomiting and had diarrhoea,‚Äù she narrates.

The clinic referred the child to Mubende Hospital on September 8, 2022. After three days of nursing her child at the patient ward, Ms Nampenjja felt weak and got admitted herself. She felt cold and was vomiting. She thought that she had contracted malaria but she wasn‚Äôt getting better.

Ms Nampenjja, like several other survivors, believes that her possible area of contact was St Florence Medical Centre.

During admission to Mubende hospital, Nampenjja also experienced nightmares at night that often forced her to jump off the bed and hide under it. It felt like some machete-wielding men were chasing her and were after her life.

‚ÄúThe dreams were very scary. When you see somebody chasing you with a panga with the intention of taking away your life, you run and hide away from the enemy. The frightening dreams appeared in different forms. I imagined that somebody was taking away my life and nobody was coming to my rescue,‚Äù she says.

ALSO READ: The clinician who got Ebola from his patient

But Ms Nampenjja is quick to reveal that witnessing several of the patients struggle in the last hour of their respective lives was even more frightening.

‚ÄúBecause I was the first in the Ebola treatment unit ward, I witnessed many patients lose the battle to the Ebola disease. I saw more than 15 people die. It was very frightening to see a patient lose control, undress and run around the patient ward. It was madness at the ward,‚Äù she reveals.

Ms Nampenjja recalls that she took quite a long time in the ward. She and her son ended up being joined by two other family members in the ward. One of them, was her 12-year-old step-daughter who succumbed to the disease at the ward.

By the time the 12-year-old was admitted to the ward, Ms Nampenjja was very ill. She only remembers the medical team carrying her away.

‚ÄúI saw the medical teams lift the girl who seemed lifeless, from her bed. Her body got wrapped in a body bag and taken away. I felt the pain that a family member had died but at the same time, I was too weak to even speak. But at least I was able to recognise what was happening,‚Äù she explains.

Her husband, Ismail Kavuma, was later brought in four days after they lost the 12-year-old child.

The family now had three patients at the Ebola patient ward.

‚ÄúI had been at the Ebola ward for two weeks but had no signs of improvement. This perhaps explains why my husband, the three-year-old child and another family member [an older step-daughter] got discharged earlier. But we had been in the same ward fighting for life,‚Äù she says.

Ms Nampenjja, who eventually recovered and is now back at home in Ngabano Village at her retail shop, says Ebola brought a big setback to her family. They lost one member of the family and registered four recovery cases.

She is quick to thank the medical team at the ETU at Mubende hospital and all the emergency teams for the love and care that facilitated their recovery. ‚ÄúDr Pasker Apiyo and her team were our parents. We had no caregivers but the team did every job that a caregiver was supposed to do at the ward. They could bring us the food, remind us about drinking juice and eating the fruits. The hospital supplied all these items,‚Äù Ms Nampenjja says.

    <title>My Ebola story: Gwokyalya nearly lost her sight before going to hospital</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/my-ebola-story-gwokyalya-nearly-lost-her-sight-before-going-to-hospital-4195252</url>

    <date>2023-04-11 11:41:05+00:00</date>
    <text>HERE: Dr Bukenya‚Äôs decision to treat Ebola patients troubled family

Ms Gwokyalya finally decided to inform her husband and children that she was not fine. From September 22 to September 28, 2022, she battled the sickness but felt no improvement. This is when she made a decision to go to Mubende hospital. She was accompanied by her husband and when they got to the health facility, the health teams named her as an Ebola contact person.

‚ÄúWhen I identified myself, the medical teams swung into action. Surprisingly, I was not immediately transferred to the Ebola treatment unit because the medical team had not received the results to confirm my status. I only remember the laboratory results were delivered on a Sunday. The results confirmed that I was Ebola positive. This is when I got transferred to the Ebola treatment unit,‚Äù she said.

After two days at the Ebola treatment unit, Ms Gwokyalya was able to drink some juice and eat a piece of pineapple.

‚ÄúIt was a terrifying experience. I felt extreme cold for two days at the ward. I tried to cover myself with a blanket but the cold nearly took my life. When I witnessed several of the patients collapse and die, I knew that it was my turn. I had nightmares and often fell off my bed in great fear. But after two weeks, I got better,‚Äù she reveals.

While at the treatment centre, Ms Gwokyalya worried about her family members back home. She had tried to isolate herself from them but thought some might have fallen sick. At the hospital, she was totally cut off from the family without any communication.

Unlike many of the other patients, Ms Gwokyala almost lost her sight even at the time of treatment. She says she would get moments when it would suddenly get dark and she could hardly see a thing or identify any object. Such episodes would happen for a few minutes at a time but they were very scary.

The medical team later realised that she was dehydrated. She was forced to eat some fruits, have some drinks and put on drip hydration. She had lost body fluids because of the severe diarrhoea and vomiting. Luckily, she is among the patients that survived, even though she had lost a lot of body fluids.

Because the Ebola isolation unit was a no-go area for the caregivers, patients who regained some strength took charge and took care of the other patients with the help of the medical teams at the patient ward.

Ms Gwokyalya was one of these. When she regained some strength and had courage to walk through the patient ward and wash some clothes, she was spotted by one of the nurses. The nurse quickly assigned her to take care of an 11-year-old patient. The boy was too weak and could hardly eat any food.

‚ÄúScovia, you are now a parent and we have given you a child. Look after this young boy by giving him some drinks. He is now your son,‚Äù Ms Gwokyalya recalls the instructions given by the nurse at the time.

‚ÄúThis was a big assignment because I was still weak and this was the only day that I had managed to get out of my bed,‚Äù Ms Gwokyalya remembers. The boy was identified as Benedicto from Madudu Sub-county in Mubende District.

‚ÄúFortunately Benedicto‚Äôs bed was next to mine. I would wake up and give this little boy a drink and pineapples. He had no appetite and had sores in his mouth and he had a swollen face. I always convinced this little boy to take some juice,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúThe nurse would come and wake me up, asking whether I had served some food to Benedicto. I made sure I did my assignment even when I felt very weak. I got more concerned about this little boy because his condition was very worrying. But God was on our side. We both survived,‚Äù she adds.

‚ÄúOne morning, just after I had regained some strength, the nurses came to my bed. I thought they had come to check on my condition. They asked whether I could talk and walk around the ward. They told me that a team from the hospital had visited my home and the family was fine. They disclosed that they were ready to escort me home since I was now fine.

‚ÄúI then received a phone call through the medical teams from health teams that informed me that they had visited my family and that they were fine. They wanted to get a clear history about my home people and possibly how I could have contracted the disease. They got all this information because at this time, I could clearly talk,‚Äù she reveals.

‚ÄúBefore receiving the good news from home, I had got troubled and had nightmares about my people. I got worried and thought that some of them were sick. But they were all safe.‚Äù

Ms Gwokyalya is happy that because she took caution and decided to self-isolate before going to the hospital, the other seven members of her family did not get infected with the Ebola virus.

‚ÄúI told my husband and children to take care. I kept away all the clothes that I was using and ensured that I washed my own clothes. This was before I got to the hospital where I was diagnosed with the Ebola virus disease,‚Äù she says.

After discharge from the hospital, Ms Gwokyalya, who settled back home, later started experiencing some joint pains but quickly informed the health teams that had been assigned to check on her.

Surprisingly, she once again started experiencing scary dreams that always made her wake up. She had a medical checkup and is now on medication but free from the Ebola virus.

Ebola

Dr Pasker Apiyo, a consultant physician who was in charge of case management for the suspected and confirmed cases at the Mubende Hospital Ebola Sudan treatment unit between September 2022 and January, explains that severe dehydration and severe bleeding was the leading cause of death for all the fatality cases.

‚ÄúIt is very possible that a severely dehydrated patient can lose balance and sight. Such a patient requires quick rehydration. We had many patients who had severe bleeding and several did not survive,‚Äù she says.</text>

    <title>Inside five years of Okoth-Ochola‚Äôs police force</title>

    <text>Why IGP sent 400 city detectives upcountry

The procurement of armoured and anti-riot equipment in huge numbers came as a surprise to many members of the public, who had viewed Okoth-Ochola as a more accommodating officer. Many had hoped that he would emphasise staff welfare, the improvement of appallingly derelict police barracks countrywide, the tackling of corruption in the Force and low pay.

There was also a belief then that this was a real chance for Uganda to restore Uganda‚Äôs police to its past self as a proper law and order civil institution, rebuild the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) and reconstitute the Special Branch, and reinstate pillar departments.

But hopes that the new police chief, a career officer with a background in criminal investigations, would steer clear of the muscular methods of his predecessor appear to have been premature.

Documents from the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development show that the police budget has increased by 40 percent since Okoth-Ochola took over from Gen Kale Kayihura in March 2018.

Much of the increase has gone towards arming the police and consolidating its increasingly paramilitary posture. The police budget increased from Shs611 billion in the Financial Year 2017/2018 to Shs975 billion this financial year.

That figure would exceed the Shs1 trillion mark if one accounted for money received under supplementary budgets.

For the last two financial years, the police annual budget has been above a trillion shillings.

Police brutality

According to the government rating in its ministerial statements, the police ‚Äòbest performance‚Äô over the last five years shows in the crack-down on legitimate civil protests and demonstrations. The police have registered an average success rate of 95 percent to this end.

For every 10 protests organised by either civil society or political opponents of the sitting National Resistance Movement (NRM) regime, Okoth-Ochola‚Äôs police stopped or prevented nine from taking place.

This, in spite of Uganda‚Äôs Constitution and other laws which protect the fundamental human right to freedoms of association, expression and peaceful assembly, among other inalienable rights.

In one of its bloodiest clamp-downs designed to assure the NRM‚Äôs dominance of Uganda‚Äôs political space, the police, in collaboration with suspected army special forces, literally shot down the November 25, 2020 protests in Kampala.

Those protests (and others held during that general election period) were set off by the violent arrest of National Unity Platform leader Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, who was campaigning for president in the middle-eastern Uganda district of Luuka.

After the tear gas and plumes of smoke from burning car tyres had cleared, the official count reported 54 people dead from gunshot wounds.

Independent observers put the toll at more than 100 killed.

Hundreds of others were gravely injured and hospitalised.

Today, it is almost impossible for the Opposition to either convene a public meeting, intra-party conference or hold a rally without attracting immediate and violent police interruption. Other high-handed actions, including the suspected abduction of regime opponents, are still associated with the police.

The police chief gets a reprieve for this state of affairs from Mr Joel Ssenyonyi, the spokesperson of the Opposition National Unity Platform party. Mr Ssenyonyi placed the blame on President Museveni‚Äôs increased posting of soldiers to key police positions.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be fully in charge. It is his military deputies and assistants who have the authority. His hands are tied. He has spoken about these things like abductions and torture, but they continue,‚Äù Mr Ssenyonyi said.

Dr Jude Kagoro, an expert in security and author of the revealing book, Inside an African Police Force, suggests that Okoth-Ochola has done his best given that he became police chief at a difficult time.

The Force appeared to be in disarray when the new chief arrived. Assistant Inspector of General of Police Andrew Felix Kaweesi had just been assassinated, while Gen Kale Kayihura, whom many officers regarded as a mentor, had been summarily sacked.

Gen Kayihura was facing trial before the Army General Court Martial for crimes related to allegations of compromising national security.

There were also real fears that the police had degenerated into a criminal organisation with rogue officers running extortion and protection rackets across the country.

‚ÄúThe confidence levels of police officers were very low,‚Äù Dr Kagoro said, adding that other security agencies immediately seized the opportunity to usurp policing duties.

Indeed, nowadays, soldiers can be seen carrying out even the most mundane of police functions, having also been drafted into the sphere of politically-motivated policing by the incumbent regime, observers note.

Dr Kagoro observes that the events which followed the change of guard at the top, including President Museveni‚Äôs insertion of several high-ranking military officers into key positions in the police, isolated the IGP and tied his hands.

‚ÄúHe has tried given the circumstances on the ground,‚Äù he said.

Changing policing

But despite existing challenges and echoes of political interference, Okoth-Ochola‚Äôs admirers take the more charitable view that he is reviving the necessary bureaucracy required for police officers to function as expected, Dr Kagoro said.

And a former Deputy Inspector General of Police agrees. Mr Julius Odwe noted, in an interview with the Daily Monitor, that the IGP knows what to do, but the drawback is that he ‚Äúis so quiet and over-delegates his tasks‚Äù.

‚ÄúHe is reserved. He is well trained. He knows the law. The only challenge is he delegates his duties so often. If the duties aren‚Äôt done well, it [comes back] to you who delegated,‚Äù Mr Odwe said.

Mr Odwe cares about the Force and keeps in touch. During the wave of insecurity marked by the notorious machete murders in Masaka and other parts of central region two years ago. Mr Odwe said that he regularly consulted with Mr Ochola and found him to be a good listener.

In a February 2019 address to regional police commander, the police chief spoke about his grand plans to transform Uganda‚Äôs police.

‚ÄúTransformation of the Uganda Police Force into a modern professional, service-oriented, pro-people and effective institution entails team work, positive mental orientation, patriotism for the nation, exertion of authority, proper judgement of situations, discipline, timely response to complaints, capacity building, and addressing the welfare of the police personnel,‚Äù he said.

To that end, he spoke of a ‚Äúprovision of a sense of belonging and direction to the personnel, good customer care, and safeguard of equipment, result-oriented policing and putting in place functional systems so that the institution operates in an organised manner‚Äù.

He rallied his subordinates with the revelation that in his first meeting with President Museveni upon being appointed police chief, he was advised to rebuild the CID and the Directorate of Crime Intelligence so that police operations become intelligence-led.

This army-style approach to police work has taken root, especially so with military officers being appointed to lead the so-called crime intelligence departments.

Mr Okoth-Ochola also said that he brought to the president‚Äôs attention areas where he needed help so as to transform the police.

Similarly, at the annual Police Council meeting in Naguru, in 2019, the new boss told colleagues that he had raised issues regarding inadequate human resources, funding, accommodation for officers, feeding of officers in operations, and training, house rent for officers operating outside barracks and maintenance of the police fleet with the president as being key factors for the transformation to occur.

Although the IGP didn‚Äôt respond to this newspaper‚Äôs request for an interview about his five years at the helm, his media team furnished us with a summary of his brief this far.

According to the brief, IGP Okoth-Ochola‚Äôs leadership has realised a reduction in the number of victims of crime from 667 people per 100,000 before he took over, to 524 in 2022.

During the 26th Police Council meeting, the Minister of Internal Affairs, who also doubles as the Chairman of the police authority, Maj Gen (rtd) Kahinda Otafiire, acknowledged these achievements, noting that Mr Ochola has done well in bringing positive change to the Force.

‚ÄúI am grateful for your effort. So far so good. The new regime; the Ochola regime, has brought a bit of sanity in the police,‚Äù Maj Gen Otafiire said. ‚ÄúI can see a big improvement.‚Äù

But the deputy secretary general at the Opposition Forum for Democratic Change political party, Mr Harold Kaija, suggests not much has changed in the broad motivation of the police under President Museveni.

‚ÄúThe general policing hasn‚Äôt changed from that of [Mr] Kayihura. He has a military deputy and many other soldiers in influential directorates. The police are as overzealous as it was before. You saw what happened in Mityana District when they tear-gassed the area Member of Parliament for talking to her constituents,‚Äù Mr Kaija said.

Mr Kaija said the incumbent IGP, like his predecessor, is focused on regime protection at whatever cost, including the blatant violation of human rights.

‚ÄúWe thought that [Mr] Ochola, being a career police officer, would spend a lot of resources on improving the welfare of his officers. [But instead] you hear of the fraud issues in the Police Exodus Sacco (police cooperative). Police officers are ill-equipped [to serve and protect citizens], and their accommodation is still deplorable,‚Äù he said.

Under Mr Ochola, he said, police posts in rural areas which offered a measure of security to ordinary people, were closed.

‚ÄúThe police aren‚Äôt meant for us, but the junta. The ministers are guarded by more police officers than some sub-counties,‚Äù he said.

He also accused IGP Ochola of falling behind on community policing, a strategy which was being embraced by the country as a useful weapon against crime.

‚ÄúThat community policing programme is now dead,‚Äù he said, adding that police officers no longer meet the community to account for their services.

There appears to be an overload of manpower around Kampala capital and the surrounding metropolitan districts. In contrast, far-flung outposts in the provinces are desperately short of men and logistics.

Routine functions like security patrols and proper CID fieldwork are almost unheard on account of either insufficient ‚Äòboots on the ground‚Äô, no fuel, or a dire lack of vehicles in the countryside.

But police spokesperson, Senior Commissioner of Police Fred Enanga, maintains that the reduction in crime rate noticed in the early years was due to Okoth-Ochola‚Äôs imaginative changes.

‚ÄúThis was achieved through re-organisation of CID and implementation of community policing strategies,‚Äù Mr Enanga said.

It should, however, be recalled that three of the past five years had Ugandans essentially confined to their homes under coronavirus pandemic lockdown protocols. This would presuppose that even criminals found themselves constrained given the closed environment.

In the first year of the new order, 238,746 cases were registered, signifying a drop of three percent from the Kayihura days. When the lockdown was fully lifted, the 2022 annual crime report said 231,653 cases were recorded, which is 7,083 cases lower than the total cases registered in 2017.

Beyond the cases registered, the new leadership continues to do poorly on the submission of case files for onward prosecution in court and in securing convictions.

For instance, a year before he took over, around 73,000 cases were taken to court in 2017 of which 22,200 convictions were secured. Up to 90,700 cases remain unresolved and are pending investigations.

Last year 68,400 cases were taken to court out of which there were 10,600 convictions, which is half of the total convictions secured in 2017. At least 136,500 cases were pending investigation last year.

Traffic accidents and fatalities were reduced by three percent in this first year, but they have since bounced back to past highs despite more proactive traffic policing.

At least 13,200 accidents were registered in 2017, of which 3,500 people died. Last year, road traffic accidents rose to 20,300 with 4,534 deaths.

A big fraction of the police development budget in the last five years has been spent on re-tooling the Force, relegating much-needed infrastructure improvements (barracks renovations and expansion, spreading the Force‚Äôs footprint, among others) to the fringes.

Top among the police spending on development projects in the last five years is the CCTV camera project.

The Command Centre at Naguru, which houses the CCTV camera project has been a particularly heavy investment. Currently, phases I and II of the CCTV camera project and monitoring centres are operational in all cities, municipalities and highways in the country.

In the same period, 1,906 vehicles, including fire tenders, riot control vehicles and ambulances. This brings the number of the police vehicle fleet to 11,132. The volatile Karamoja is one of the areas which received military-grade armoured fighting vehicles given the unique security requirements of the sub-region wracked as it is by armed cattle rustling and violent crime.

Mr Enanga underlines improvements in the quality of forensic services and fingerprinting of guns in the possession of police, prison, Uganda People‚Äôs Defence Forces and other security agencies to nearly 98 percent as another progressive development.

‚Äú[He has] built the capacity of the forensic lab to support investigation with scientific evidence by equipping it with the Automated Fingerprint Identification System, DNA [analysis], Cogent Automated Biometric Identification System and scene of crime officer kits,‚Äù Mr Enanga said.

The second priority has been human resource administration and training. More than Shs1 trillion has been spent on in the last five years.

Mr Enanga said 11,276 officers were recruited and trained, bringing the police strength to around 54,000.

‚ÄúDuring that period, police trained 22,040 in-service personnel under several refresher and specialised courses,‚Äù Mr Enanga said.

Welfare wishes

Still, being a career officer, it had been anticipated inside the Force that attention to welfare would be more pronounced under the post-Kayihura administration.

However, the budget for police welfare has drastically dropped from Shs80 billion in 2018 when IGP Ochola took over to just Shs5 billion in the 2022/2023 financial year, according to Finance ministry documents.

The accommodation crisis persists, and is actually getting out of control.

After the police recruited 11,000 officers in five years, the housing shortage increased to 35,000 units. And the existing 9,200 housing units are in desperate shape, falling apart and should be condemned in many cases. Barracks across the country suffer from terrible sewage and waste disposal, making them susceptible to disease outbreaks.

Mr Enanga said 585 houses have been built and 5,410 unipots installed but this barely scratches the surface of the housing crisis.

It is true that the leadership raised the food issue, manpower inadequacies, vehicle shortages and accommodation during a Police Council meeting attended by President Museveni. But the commander-in-chief‚Äôs response may have dampened optimism.

The president is reported to have instead proposed a reduction in the number of police officers sitting at sub-county posts to just 20 men. He also suggested that police should use bicycles to get around. Bicycles were last used for policing in Uganda by the colonial police department more than half a century ago.

There also appears to be a relative stagnation with the police witnessing the fewest promotions and salary increments in the last 23 years over the Ochola period. Only 773 senior officers have been promoted while 3,400 junior officers were promoted to various ranks. Except police scientists, who got salary enhancement alongside colleagues in government, non-scientists (junior officers) have got a salary increment only once.

It is a mixed bag for the quiet man who replaced the aggressive and action-packed Kayihura order with his own version of a firm, and sometimes understated approach.

Mr Enanga sees a sea change with welfare issues being addressed, partly through reforming the Exodus Sacco and Police Savings Association Limited, which were suffering from numerous accountability challenges.

‚ÄúPolice Exodus Sacco management was re-organised and structures put in place to enable its continuity in giving out of credit facilities,‚Äù he said.

Corruption cancer

Graft, both inside the police and in its relations with the general public only seems to get worse.

Almost every annual report on government corruption issued by public and private agencies marks the Uganda police out as the most graft-ridden institution in the country. Same findings have been made in recent reports on human rights abuse produced by the Uganda Human Rights Commission and other rights defenders.

According to reports by the Inspectorate of Government in the last five years, the police have remained the most corrupt institution in Uganda.

‚ÄúThis is according to the Fourth National Integrity Survey Report, which ranked the general police as the worst department in extorting money from members of the public in the form of bribery. The general duties police, standing at 70 per cent overall, was followed by the traffic police department at 67 per cent and the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID),‚Äù the Inspectorate report released in 2022 reads in part.

Similar surveys carried out by Transparency International in the same period have also shown that the police remains firmly perched atop the list of the most corrupt institutions.

As with Gen Kayihura, IGP Okoth-Ochola may discover that the Uganda Police Force has a life of its own.</text>

    <title>Bomb fragments a pain in our flesh, say LRA war survivors</title>

    <date>2023-04-10 18:27:44+00:00</date>
    <text>On the evening of May 14, 1993, Uganda People‚Äôs Defence Forces (UPDF) soldiers raided Boli pii Village in Paibona Parish, Gulu District.

The raid was prompted by a tip that the UPDF received alleging that there were Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (LRA) rebels camped in one of the homesteads adjacent to a creek.

Joyce Aloyo‚Äôs family lived in the village at the time.

She says on the fateful night, her parents instructed her and her siblings to lock themselves in one of the huts in their compound. This, according to her parents, was safer than trekking 8km to Paibona Trading Centre, which was well-guarded. This is where the community often went to seek shelter at night during such incidences.

‚ÄúOnce the rebels passed by, they would ignore your compound thinking the occupants have fled to safety,‚Äù Ms Aloyo says.

She says moments after locking themselves in the hut, they heard rebels speaking in hushed voices after which a fierce exchange of gunfire erupted.

‚ÄúAll we knew was that the rebels were on our side and the UPDF soldiers were hitting them from across the stream on the other side,‚Äù she adds.

Ten minutes later, a grenade was tossed into the hut.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened but I regained my senses three days later and found that I was admitted to Awach Health Centre,‚Äù Ms Aloyo says.

As she writhed in pain, her father told her that the grenade killed one of her brothers and left her seriously injured.

He further said the grenade was meant for the rebels.

Ms Aloyo‚Äôs wounds were quite severe and for the first six months, she was attended to by surgeons at both Gulu Hospital and St Mary‚Äôs Hospital Lacor.

‚ÄúThere was no improvement on each side and my mother contacted organisations like AVSI [Foundation] to support me at the Orthopaedic Unit of Gulu Hospital but the wounds were not healing,‚Äù she says.

She adds that a non-governmental organisation (NGO) procured crutches for her and paid her monthly medical bills for nearly five years. The organisation, however, later halted the support.

The organisation suggested that Ms Aloyo should get amputated but she refused.

Ms Joyce Aloyo

‚ÄúI still wanted to live with all my limbs. However, they did not tell me that to treat my wound, [bomb] fragments that got stuck in my leg had to be removed,‚Äù she says.

She adds that her mother sought support from other organisations but many said they were financially constrained.

Despite the pain, Ms Aloyo continued with her studies and in 2004 completed Primary Seven.

‚ÄúI struggled, my foot got swollen and it hurt and leaked. I could not sit from morning to noon in class. I would study for half a day and return home to boil water and do dressing because the wound was not healing, while fellow pupils bullied me,‚Äù Ms Aloyo says.

‚ÄúIn the class, I could not sit on the desk, I would move with a sack and put in front of the class and sit down because the condition could not allow me, it would pain a lot. Most pupils would abuse me seriously, and the toilet system at school was the worst challenge,‚Äù she adds.

Ms Aloyo says in 2009, an organisation offered to treat war victims at Lacor Hospital.

However, when she went for the surgical camp to remove the bomb fragments in her right leg and correct her metatarsals (bones in the feet), she was shocked to learn that she had to pay Shs27m for the surgery.

‚ÄúI returned home and told my grandmother that I had given up on life. However, later that year, the National Union of Disabled Persons in Uganda (NUDIPU) enrolled me on life skills training during which I learnt hairdressing and acquired a certificate.‚Äù

She, however, says it is difficult for her to do the job because of her injuries.

‚ÄúI have gone for radiography at Lacor Hospital many times and the doctors have barred me from sitting or standing for too long because of the damage in both my right leg and the waist.‚Äù

A medical x-ray film generated from Lacor Hospital recently indicates that the unrepaired damage in her right leg has progressively caused damage to muscles in her waist and groin such that it continues to aggravate her movement.

Ms Aloyo says she got married but it did not last. She had two boyfriends after that but the relationships did not last.

‚ÄúAt my last home in Bungatira Sub-county, the man‚Äôs relatives openly chased me away from home. He was a boda-boda rider and they would storm into my house and remove food forcefully,‚Äù Ms Aloyo says.

She has three children but says she can barely take care of them.

‚ÄúThey feed and clothe themselves. They have to study and be treated when they are ill but it has been a battle that I failed to fight. The children are now moving around in homesteads digging and weeding in people‚Äôs gardens, fetching water and doing all sorts of petty things just to secure food for a day,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúIf only the government or a well-wisher came out to support her to pay for her medical treatment, support her children in school, and help her with other needs, she would be better,‚Äù Ms Margaret Aneno, Aloyo‚Äôs aunt and caretaker said.

In 1993 while returning home from Orom Trading Centre in Kitgum District in the afternoon, Mr Alfred Otema and his two brothers walked into a rebel ambush.

‚ÄúThe village was a target by the rebels and they had just been repelled by the soldiers. However, when we entered the ambush, all I remember was the sporadic gunshots fired at us as we fled in disarray,‚Äù Mr Otema said.

Mr Otema was shot and lost consciousness. When he came back to his senses two days later, he found that he had been admitted at Kitgum Hospital.

He was told that four bullets pierced his knee and two got stuck in his left femur, causing him to bleed to near death. His right leg was amputated a week later but the bullets in his left femur were never removed.

‚ÄúI have lived with it for now but this incapacitation limited my ability to achieve my vision as a young man. I never went to school and I cannot do any meaningful physical work that can earn me money for survival because I am disabled,‚Äù he said.

Mr Otema has two wives‚Äî one in Orom, Kitgum and another in Gulu - who are taking care of him. He is a cobbler and works near Gulu Regional Referral Hospital to be able to fend for his family, which includes four children.

‚ÄúThe money I raise from mending shoes cannot pay school fees for my children. At times I go for a week without working and that is when everything becomes hell. The same money is not enough to purchase a plot of land on which these children will survive tomorrow,‚Äù he says.

In 2002, LRA rebels led by Okot Ngwinya Aye Rwota from the Sinia Brigade raided Opota Trading Centre at dawn and clobbered to death 28 locals using hoes. Their victims were sliced to pieces and survivors of the massacre were ordered to cook and eat them.

Nekolina Adong, 63, and Josephine Akullu, 58, are victims of the attack.

The duo fled the massacre but were struck by bullets, which are still lodged in their bodies.

‚ÄúI fought for my life at the time from Dr Ambrosoli Hospital in Agago for six years but eventually, it somehow healed in my body but I cannot do vigorous work and carry a weight more than 8kg as instructed by medics because it triggers the excruciating pain,‚Äù Ms Adong says.

Ms Akullu says she is yet to recover from this horrific ordeal.

‚ÄúI have not moved on. I pray that government comes in to offer us the treatment and psychosocial support in the aftermath of the massacre, I cannot walk or move for long and barely do any work,‚Äù she says.



War scars

Since 1986, rebel groups wreaked havoc in Acholi, Lango, Teso and West Nile sub-regions, killing thousands.

The rebel activities forced many to seek shelter in Internally Displaced Camps, whose conditions were not favourable due to congestion.

It is estimated that more than 10,000 survivors were injured in the rebel attacks with some being permanently disfigured.

Others were victims of torture which they were subjected to by the UPDF soldiers.

In 2018, the Feinstein International Center - Tufts University conducted a victimisation assessment survey in which their findings detailed how the LRA‚Äôs attacks directed against civilians resulted in killings, attempted murder, enslavement, torture, rape and sexual slavery among others.

Two-thirds of the 2,605 victims sampled during the assessment had a disability and half of the disabled ‚Äúcould not work a lot‚Äù or they ‚Äúcould not work at all‚Äù as a result of injuries sustained due to the war.

‚ÄúThe combination of the high numbers of war crimes committed by the LRA and the resulting physical injury and disability, poorer mental wellbeing, the stripping and destruction of their assets, and their reduced ability to carry out livelihoods has resulted in these households being unable to afford to enrol and keep their child attending school,‚Äù the report read in part.

The report further said the victims had asked for rehabilitation, therapeutic care, livelihood support, financial restitution and compensation, and educational provision for their families.

The 2006 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement between the government and the rebels marked the beginning of reconstruction interventions led by the government, development partners, civil society organisations and community-based initiatives.

Some of the more prominent programmes include the Peace Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) and Northern Uganda Action Fund II.

However, these organisations have largely focussed on infrastructure development as and issue of critical human development and the rehabilitation of victims of this insurgency by providing post-trauma social and welfare support‚Äîhas been pushed to the backburners.

Despite over a decade of reconstruction interventions, a revived focus on human development frameworks remains critical in facilitating the transition from recovery to development.

There is little support that has been provided by the government towards rehabilitating victims who have bomb fragments and bullets stuck in their bodies save for efforts by cash-strapped non-governmental organisations.

For example, TPO Uganda, in collaboration with partners such as Mental Health Uganda, has innovatively steered efforts in medication accessibility by educating beneficiaries on expenditure and medication costs.

The initiative is termed the drug bank where it seeks to provide integrated physical and psychological rehabilitation assistance to war victims in Awach Sub-county, Gulu District and Lakwana Sub-county, Omoro District as well as Mucwini Sub-county in Kitgum District.

During the five-year intervention, TPO Uganda conducted specialised surgical treatment in which it supported 78 females and 116 males to have bullets removed from their bodies.

It has also been able to carry out psychosocial education in which 2,507 beneficiaries were given psychological support and another 178 treated.

AVSI Foundation in Uganda and Refugee Law Project in the past, have also had a positive impact in supporting war-affected communities in overcoming the pain of living with the fragments in their bodies, emotional difficulties and psychological distress.

These interventions have had positive effects on the community such as more victims can now access surgical treatment, the reduction of depression relapse, the improvement of social functioning and active engagement in community activities.

Between 2008 and 2015, AVSI Foundation with support from the Italian government produced and gave more than 2,500 prostheses under the Gulu Regional Orthopaedic Workshop project in northern Uganda.

The centre provides prosthetic limbs, orthopaedic appliances, physiotherapy, counselling and psychotherapy services.

However, most NGOs have since closed or scaled down their operations.

Mr Fred Ngomokwe of Refugee Law Project, says victims should have their limbs replaced.

‚ÄúSo, they are getting spoilt and broken while others have physically changed or grown up and the limbs cannot match their body figures and need change,‚Äù he says

He says many victims cannot afford treatment and rehabilitation at hospitals.

‚ÄúIf you are to buy the limbs, you need more than Shs1 million which cannot be afforded by the victims and if you are to go for specialised surgeries like the rectal prolapse, removal of fragments, correction of septic wounds and plastic surgeries, [it is too costly],‚Äù Mr Ngomokwe told this publication.

Before the Covid-19 outbreak, Ms Stella Lanam, the War Victims and Children Networking director and also an LRA victim, says they were partnering with some organisations such as the Refugee Law Project (RLP) and the Centre for Victims of Torture to handle their medication and treatment to remove the bullets and splinters from victims‚Äô bodies before the projects closed.

‚ÄúThese projects recently closed and the victims are in a dire situation. If you go to Gulu Regional Referral Hospital, the situation is horrible and these health facilities cannot deal with them yet the victims do not have the funds. The government should do something to medically support these groups,‚Äù Ms Lalam says.

    <text>When the Ministry of Health declared an Ebola outbreak in Mubende District on Tuesday, September 20, the Uganda Red Cross Society, a leading humanitarian organisation in Uganda, deployed response teams in the districts of Mubende and Kassanda.

The team was tasked with providing safe and dignified burials for Ebola victims and holding community sensitisations against the beliefs that the deaths were witchcraft-related.

Mr Hamza Badru Mulyazaawo, 33, a Red Cross volunteer from the Kampala West branch, was a member of the 22 Red Cross staff deployed in Mubende.

He said their first task involved taming the hostile community.

‚ÄúAt the beginning, the community was so hostile. They couldn‚Äôt believe that their loved ones were dying of Ebola. I recall a scenario in Kirwanyi Village, Kiruma Sub-county, where one family had refused us to bury their loved one, but we had to explain why we had camped in the area,‚Äù he says.

The family and community leaders eventually allowed the Red Cross team to conduct the burial. Mr Mulyazaawo says they are trained scientists who understand how to deal with stigma.

‚ÄúThe community discriminated against us. Whenever you could go to a shop to buy something like soap or toothpaste, you could meet people who ask you if you had ever been infected [by Ebola], but we kept focused on our ambition,‚Äù he says.

Mr Mulyazaawo recounts the scary moments associated with burying people who succumbed to the disease. He says dealing with a dead person whom he had never seen or met before was hard. What made it more difficult was having to manage the bodies of those who had died of Ebola.

‚ÄúAt the time of death [of an Ebola victim], blood would come out of the nose, mouth and ears. It is as if the body had been pulled out of a room full of blood. Such bodies scared us a lot, but we had to deal with them,‚Äù he narrates.

He says sometimes, he would lack sleep at night due to bad dreams and nightmares.

‚ÄúSometimes when the light was switched off and the place was completely dark, I could see what looked like the bodies of the people we buried,‚Äô‚Äô Mr Mulyazaawo recounts.

In his line of work, there are things one can never forget. For Mulyazaawo, it is the time he first came face-to-face with a dead body of a woman.

‚ÄúI was so scared, I had never touched a dead body in my life. I had only seen two dead bodies, the one of my grandmother and that of my grandfather. Since my childhood, I feared dead bodies, but this time round, I had to be courageous .

‚ÄúThe woman had a lot of discharge from her nose, ears, and mouth. I had to clean her thoroughly. For two weeks, I could not eat meat or chicken, and whenever I slept, I dreamt about the lady. I even feared sleeping in the dark,‚Äù he recounts.

As a Muslim, when such scary moments came, he performed ablution and would pray two times before she went to bed bed.

On average, during the Ebola outbreak, every member of the team had to bury two bodies every day. The situation became worse when President Museveni placed a 12-day lockdown in the districts of Mubende and Kassanda. No one was allowed to bury a relative, whether they had died of Ebola or not.

‚ÄúWe were overwhelmed by dead bodies in the first phase of a lockdown, at times, we could bury at night, which was ethically against our rules, but because of the pressure, we had to do it,‚Äù he recalls.

‚ÄúOur efforts started paying of because some families had been spend two to three days with dead bodies. The situation started normalising after the Red Cross trained more volunteers to participate in the burials at sub-county level in both two districts,‚Äù he adds.

Mr Mulyazaawo says due to the nightmares of handling dead bodies, the team resolved to fix ways of relaxing their minds after a long days work. They resorted to playing music and frequenting leisure places . This, however, did not end well for some of the members.

On October 30, 2022, police arrested a number of the Red Cross burial team members for allegedly being in a bar at Homeland Guest House in Mubende. The were accused of violating lockdown rules. The next day, Tuesday, November 1, they were arraigned in court and charged with negligent acts that were likely to cause the spread of Ebola and violation of the presidential directives.

Mr Mulyazaawo says the volunteers were trying to get rid of the nightmares after the day‚Äôs work.

‚ÄúLifting those heavy bodies and putting on coveralls would get us dehydrated and you could not sleep. So we decided to go and roast our goat meat and played some music, it wasn‚Äôt loud. Unfortunately police arrested our colleagues,‚Äù he claims.

Joining Red Cross

Mr Mulyazaawo, who joined the Red Cross Society in 2019, does not regret doing voluntary work.

‚ÄúI joined the Red Cross Society in 2019 after getting in an accident in 2018. The team from Red Cross helped me a lot in [treatment and healing]. I got interested in joining their service and I have never looked back,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúI will always serve society. For me, being in Mubende means I was serving humanity,‚Äù Mr Mulyazaawo adds.

Mr Mulyazaawo also told this publication that the Red Cross team is made up of all religions and tribes. This is done so that they [team] can cope with the customs and beliefs of the people they are dealing with.

‚ÄúA Muslim should work on a Muslim and a Christian should work on Christian. Someone from one tribe should be worked on by someone from that particular tribe,‚Äô‚Äô he said.

Before joining Red Cross Society, Mulyazaawo had a well-paying job at a company that deals in commercial kitchenware and fabrication of kitchen equipment such as ovens and bakery tools.

The reserved gentleman is married with two daughters. ‚ÄúMy wife knows the kind of job I do and she is supportive because she knows I love it,‚Äô‚Äô he says.

Mr Mulyazaawo, however, says his mother was worried of him being an Ebola frontline worker.

‚ÄúMy mother always gets scared whenever there is an outbreak and when I was in Mubende, she still kept calling me asking whether I was okay ,‚Äù he says.

About Ebola

It is a deadly virus with initial symptoms which can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. Subsequent stages can include vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding, known as haemorrhaging.</text>

    <text>When the Ebola virus disease outbreak was declared in Uganda, with Mubende District as the epicentre, several families, who were suspected and confirmed cases, faced rejection by communities due to myths and misconceptions.

This came despite the sensitisation from the emergency response and health teams.

Ismail Kavuma, 58, a resident of Kiyinja Village, Kiruuma Sub-county in Mubende, and survivor of the disease, is one such victim.

He experienced a difficult time when five members of his family, including himself, contracted Ebola. One of them died, another was admitted for weeks on end and the family faced stigma from the community.

Kavuma believes that his 12-year-old daughter contracted the disease from a medical centre located in Madudu Sub-county where had been taken there to receive medical care. At that time, the Ebola outbreak had not been declared.

His daughter was referred to Mubende Hospital in the second week of September, 2022. By this time, many patients were being referred from this particular clinic to the hospital but nobody knew about Ebola. It was only in the third week of September when the government declared the outbreak that people realised the disease was in the area. Unfortunately, Kavuma‚Äôs daughter succumbed to the disease.

‚ÄúMy daughter died in the second week of September 2022. My wife who had nursed the child was already admitted to Mubende Hospital battling an unknown illness,‚Äù he says.

At this point, another of his children, a three-year-old boy, had also fallen sick and was in the hospital with his mother.

‚ÄúWhen they tested positive for Ebola virus, I was stopped from taking care of them. This was the time I also felt general body weakness and started vomiting. I also got diarrhoea. The health teams quickly evacuated me to the Ebola treatment unit at Mubende Hospital,‚Äù Kavuma shares.

When his wife, Ms Annet Nampenjja, was admitted to Mubende General Referral Hospital, she was very weak but the medical staff attending to her could not figure out what the illness was despite the different laboratory tests.

He explains that it is possible that his wife was among the very first Ebola patients admitted to Mubende Hospital because the government declared the Ebola outbreak a week after she had been admitted.

Kavuma reveals that he had tested negative for the disease when the blood samples were tested the first time. However, the second blood sample returned positive results.

Later after he had been admitted, another older daughter of his was also admitted. Before then, Kavuma says, he had not seen his wife and child for more than 10 days because the Ebola treatment unit was restricted to only the medical teams.

‚ÄúWhen I looked at my child and wife, I got frightened although I was equally very weak at the time I was transferred to the ward. It was messed up. All the patients were struggling and many were dropping off their respective patient beds and crying for help,‚Äù Kavuma says.

Many survivors claim that patients would develop mental challenges and would start undressing andshouting. The same happened to Kavuma. He remembers the time he struggled and fell off his bed at the ward countless times. Because of his body size, the medical teams and patients abandoned him on the floor for some time. He was only lifted back to his bed after he had calmed down and would not fall off the bed. He lost appetite for food for more than five days.

‚ÄúI could only take some juice after the medical teams convinced me that if I failed to drink the juice, I would die. I had already witnessed patients that had collapsed and died at the ward,‚Äù Kavuma says.

‚ÄúI thank the medical staff and the hospital for ensuring that we had enough fruits and the juice to eat and drink. I had never experienced such a loving and caring medical team. They became caregivers and wanted us to get better,‚Äù he adds.

After spending two weeks at the ward, Kavuma and his son got better.

‚ÄúWe soon got the good news that we would leave the patient ward after testing negative,‚Äù he says, adding that he and his son got discharged but his wife remained at the hospital for two more weeks.

Getting back to the community

When the family left the hospital, they remained confined at their home at Kiyinja Village, Kiruuma Sub-county, for the first three weeks.

Kavuma explains that many people feared to come to his home yet they had no food to eat.

‚ÄúWe were discriminated against by the community. When we sent the children to go and buy some items at the nearby shops, the shop attendants nearly chased the children away. They did not want to touch the money,‚Äù he says.

Despite the sensitisation by the health teams, a section of the community believed that our home had the Ebola disease and were afraid of coming to our home. They only waved from a distance,‚Äù Kavuma adds.

Later, when his children went to school to complete their third term, they were stigmatised by their fellow pupils. A section of the children refused to share the desks in class with them and named then Ebola. The two children then reportedly stopped going to school for the rest of the term.

‚ÄúI felt much pain when my two children dropped out of school over discrimination. They could not share the same desks and became lonely in school,‚Äù Kavuma says.

‚ÄúIt took a whole month for a section of the residents to accept my family members as normal and Ebola-free. But I do not blame the community for the discriminative acts because of the myths and misinformation. The community believed that the Ebola virus disease could easily spread from my family since we had spent time at the isolation facility in Mubende,‚Äù Kavuma says.

He believes that the absence of a vibrant community health care system and the failure by the government to ensure that the village health teams get a monthly remuneration partly compromised the health of the residents.

‚ÄúIf we had a vibrant health team at the grassroots, the Ebola virus disease would have been detected early before it claimed lives. The patients got treatment at the nearby clinic without realising that the Ebola virus disease was already in the community,‚Äù he says.

Kavuma ends on a positive note, however, thankful for those who took care of the patients.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how the emergency response teams identified the health teams that worked at the Mubende Ebola treatment unit. The health workers were very caring despite the fact that they were dealing with a deadly disease,‚Äù he says.

    <title>The festering wounds of LRA insurgency</title>

    <text>In Limu Village, Gulu East Division, 21-year-old Josephine Ayo walks out of a rickety hut. With a poignant gaze, she sits on the bench to narrate her story.

After a brief prayer, she is overcome with emotion and grief. Tears roll down her cheeks.

Ayo, a single mother of one, lives with four siblings in a shabby slum in Gulu Town along with several other Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (LRA) war victims.

She says her in laws and neighbours asked her husband to disown her because she was born in captivity.

‚ÄúHe changed his mind and chased me from his house and said because of my background. He dropped a plan of take me back to school and supporting my siblings. He claimed I had demonic spirits in me and could kill at any time,‚Äù Ayo narrates.

Ayo now works as food vendor on the streets of Gulu City.

In 1993, Ayo‚Äôs mother, Regina Acayo was abducted from Lawiyadul Village, Angagura Sub-county in Pader District. She was 14 at the time.

Acayo says she returned 11 years later in 2004 with two children‚ÄîAyo and her elder sister.

‚ÄúUpon return, the welcome in the village was not encouraging. I later realised that my parents were killed by the rebels. My brothers and uncles asked me to take the children to their father where they belong before I could be embraced into the family,‚Äù Acayo told Daily Monitor in an interview.

She says she decided to return to Gulu Town.

‚ÄúRight now I have five children, two from captivity, and three with two different men. One of the men said marrying me a former captive was a bad omen while the other hated my daughters because of their background,‚Äù she adds.

Acayo says she is not sure whether the father of her two older children returned from captivity or was killed.

‚ÄúI traced the father of my two children in vain. I heard that he was killed in captivity after I returned. I also heard that he returned home. I failed to trace him because he told me a different name and a village that does not exist,‚Äù she says.

Acayo hopes to secure a piece of land so that she can build a home for her family. She is worried that her children will drop out of school because she cannot pay their tuition fees.

The LRA rebellion started in 1987 under the command of Joseph Kony. The war lasted close to two decades.

As Gulu emerges from the ruin of the war with a new skyline and sleek roads, this festering wound that left thousands dead, abducted, and hundreds of young girls defiled and raped and millions huddled inside squalid Internally Displaced People‚Äôs camps‚Äî is yet to heal.

Betty Lalam, a war victim and the proprietor of the Gulu War Affected Training Centre (GWATC), says the discrimination and the failure of the former returnees to re-integrate into society is worrying.

‚ÄúThe women may have returned with two, three or four children but here produce three more children with different fathers but the men are not willing to associate with their children when they discover that they were once captives.‚Äù

Lalam says a handful of returnees who were able to acquire life skills training with different organisations have been able to fend for themselves.

‚ÄúThey do small businesses to ensure that their children are back in school or are at least eating every day because they have something to do,‚Äù Lalam reveals.

Lalam was abducted by the rebels when she was a child

Evelyn Amony, a former wife of Kony, who returned from captivity with three children, says she decided to settle in Gulu Town because of the rejection and stigma she was subjected to by the community in her ancestral village.

‚ÄúI returned in 2005 but I could only reach home in 2008. But I spent only three days at home and returned to Gulu Town. In the three days, I heard a lot of things said by the community against me and my children and it pushed me towards suicide,‚Äù Amony says.

She adds that her decision not to reunite with her family was based on the LRA‚Äôs past atrocities in her village in Atiak, in Amuru District where hundreds of people were massacred by the rebels.

‚ÄúThey referred to us as murderers and demonics who could kill at any moment,‚Äù Amony says.

On April 22, 1995, LRA rebels led by Vincent Otti carried out one of ghastliest killing sprees, slaughtering more than 200 in Atiak who had gathered for the market day.

She says the repugnant Acholi culture, which isolates a woman who gives birth without formal marriage, has created barriers towards integration.

‚ÄúIf you are in that category of women, especially the returnees who even have children whose fathers are not known, your parents are likely to disown you because they did not reap any benefits [in terms of marriage] from you and because you also never went to school,‚Äù Amony says.

She adds: ‚ÄúIn certain situations, they even condition the man that for them they don‚Äôt want a former captive as their daughter-in-law. They think such a woman has bad spirits and once annoyed can attack and kill any family member at any moment.‚Äù

Amony is the chairperson of the Women Advocacy Network, an association helping 975 former female captives from across Acholi, Lango, Teso and West Nile sub-regions.

While efforts have been made to reunite children with their families, very few communities have embraced them. It is estimated that thousands of children, who were born in captivity, have failed to re-integrate with their families.

Some of these children and their mothers have post-traumatic stress disorder and experience flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety and depression.

For more than 15 years after the war subsided, various organisations have tried to trace and link children to their families. Some of the organisations involved include Justice and Reconciliation Project (JRP), Caritas, and Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative (ARLPI).

Child tracing is a tedious sensitive and emotionally charged process, which is in the best interest of the child. The process of child tracing emerged as a social project considered vital to the well-being of children born as the result of forced marriages in captivity.

‚ÄúSome communities say they don‚Äôt have land to accommodate these children, especially because the identities of their fathers are not known. Other women are even conditioned by their families to chase the children away before they can return to the family,‚Äù Amony says.

A 2018 Justice and Reconciliation Project (JRP) report indicated that 90 percent of the 447 returnee women interviewed, suffered stigmatisation, rejection, trauma, behavioural challenges, failure to meet basic needs, and failed access to land.

Of the 1,609 children aged between one and 31 years under the care of the women sampled, at least 80 percent of those aged above five were in school although 90 percent of them faced financial difficulty in paying school dues.



Twenty-seven percent of the 1,609 children were conceived because of an act of sexual violence against the mother.

In 2019, Parliament resolved to support all formerly abducted women and children born in captivity during the LRA insurgency. But this is yet to be implemented.

In August 2021, then Speaker Jacob Oulanyah wrote to the Prime Minister seeking government‚Äôs intervention in the matter.

‚ÄúWar Victims and Children Networking have brought to my attention that the resolution passed by Parliament on February 13, 2019 has never been implemented. I am thus writing to bring to your attention the outstanding resolution for your consideration,‚Äù the letter reads in part.

In the 2019 resolution, Parliament was meant to identify and profile the affected victims and create specific financing for former female LRA abductees and their children born in captivity.

It was also agreed to embark on sensitisation campaigns to closely have joint programmes with cultural institutions to ensure that these victims of abduction and their children are socially integrated and protected to avoid stigmatisation and discrimination perpetuated against them as well as expedite the adoption of the transitional justice policy.

Stella Lanam, the director of War Victims and Children Networking, says they have now written more than 30 letters to Parliament and the Office of the Prime Minister to follow up on the matter but have yet to get a response.

‚ÄúWe have sent multiple letters to seek support from the government but to no avail, and now the victims are living in very critical conditions. During the Covid-19 lockdown many of the victims committed suicide because of their hard life including our children,‚Äù she says.

Efforts to get a comment from Ms Grace Kwiyucwiny, the State minister for Northern Uganda under the Office of the Prime Minister, were futile as she did not answer our repeated calls.

Lanam says: ‚ÄúFrom captivity, most of the children changed their names.‚Äù

Ms Simple Anena, who was abducted by the LRA rebels, tends to her garden on March 16 at Abili Trading Centre, Koro Sub-county, Omoro District.

These victims have also been locked out of government poverty alleviation programmes like the Parish Development Model.

Lanam opines: ‚ÄúWe even encouraged our members to go to sub-counties and register to benefit from government project but in the end, they are left out and excluded. Survival for our members is not easy, our capacity as an organisation is so limited to support the thousands of victims, and we currently sponsor 100 children of victims in school.‚Äù

REACTION

Mr Fred Ngomokwe, a Human Rights defender with Refugee Law Project, says the commercialisation of land during and after the LRA insurgency bred greed and victims of the insurgency were left out.

‚ÄúAfter after the war boundary issues became a big challenge, location and land sizes including directives for you to know the land is a challenge because the people supposed to guide are either dead in the war or are not interested due to commercialised land selling,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúTo make it worst, our people who were abducted and returned from captivity, had it rough in terms of the welcoming, very few were welcomed home and their welcome was sustained. Those welcomed were either denied the right to own land,‚Äù Mr Ngomokwe says.

Mr Ngomokwe suggests that idle land owned by the government should be converted to settle such a population.

‚ÄúThere are many redundant lands in the region that government owns like in Apaa, or even in Lakang, they could be used to resettle these groups of people, and the modality of allocation is something that needs a roundtable sitting,‚Äù he says.

He also expressed frustration with several interventions of government to extend help to victims.

‚ÄúIt is high time the government got its pieces together to rethink its modalities with all these interventions of NUSAF, DINU, PDM, etc., something should have been different for victims of war. The interventions should be victim-centred so that they can see the benefits,‚Äù he says.

Billions of shillings have been spent as part of the ‚Äòmarshall plan‚Äô to rehabilitate the war-ravaged region. But a large chunk of the funds has allegedly been embezzled by government officials.

The LRA was responsible for the abduction of up to 60,000 children and youth in the north during the course of the insurgency.

This war has contributed to the rise in numbers of street children in northern Uganda, especially in Gulu. Many have turned to crime to survive.

Athur Owor, a policy analyst and researcher, says there is need to offer help to this community.

Government, which ought to offer support has abdicated its role leaving this to the financially hamstrung humanitarian organisations.

‚ÄúIf you studied the national Transitional Justice Policy very clearly, political will versus political interest, we still don‚Äôt have the bill to support that policy, so that bill is hanging somewhere probably with Cabinet and needs to be pushed out,‚Äù Owor argues.

Mr Ambrose Olaa, the Acholi chiefdom premier, says the redefinition of land ownership after the LRA war created barriers for war victims.

‚ÄúThe war messed up the traditional understanding of the context of land ownership, for whom and how the land was held and got replaced by a reckless interpretation of both the traditional and formal definitions in the constitution regarding land ownership, he said.

‚ÄúThere was the emergence of the land market policies which changed land from being held for its intrinsic values to being held more for its material and commercial value, hence putting land onto the shelves. The implication was that the more land you could grab, or have,‚Äù Olaa argues.

He adds that After the transformations, people started to grab land presumably from the more vulnerable sections of communities such as the orphans and widows, and former captives.</text>

    <title>My Ebola story: Nyangoma cried for her Bible</title>
    <url>https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/my-ebola-story-nyangoma-cried-for-her-bible-4184374</url>
    <author>['Daily Monitor']</author>
    <date>2023-04-04 10:21:04+00:00</date>
    <text>To a Christian, the Bible is a sacred book and one of their most jealously guarded properties. When Christine Nyangoma, an Ebola virus disease survivor, was asked to hand over her Bible among other properties in preparation for discharge at the hospital, tears rolled down her face.

Nyangoma, a wife to a pastor and a resident of Kijjaguzo Village, Madudu Sub-county in Mubende District, has bitter memories of that time. Her Bible was precious to her, she read it each time she had strength to do so as a patient at the ward, and had managed to keep it safely.

As the time approached to have her discharged, she was worried that her property that included her Bible, mobile phone and clothes would be taken and burnt.

While she had been informed about the reason the property had to be destroyed, she was uncomfortable with the idea of burning her Bible.

‚ÄúI had never imagined in life that at one time, I would voluntarily surrender my Bible for destruction. It almost amounted to denying my faith although I had been briefed by the medical staff as to why all the personal property that I had been using had to be destroyed,‚Äù she says in an interview.

Even after the property had been withdrawn on the date she was due for discharge, Nyangoma says she was ready to fight for her Bible untill the last minute.

The last tactic she had was to wear on a gloomy face and possibly shed tears to attract the attention of the guests including the Health minister who had come to officially discharge four survivors at the Ebola treatment unit.

‚ÄúWhen the Health minister observed my miserable face, she asked why I was very miserable at a time when I was supposed to be happy to rejoin my family after the treatment. I explained that my Bible was going to be destroyed,‚Äù she says.

Touched by her statement, the Health minister, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, assured her that she would get a new Bible.

‚ÄúWhile I lost the battle to get back my original Bible, the hope was in the new Bible that was bought for me. The Bible had been my fighting weapon at the patient ward whenever I regained strength to pray to God for my healing and that of other patients,‚Äù Nyangoma reveals.

Medical research shows that the Ebola virus can survive on body surfaces for several hours and has the ability to survive for several days at room temperature. This necessitates high grade disinfection.

Dr Pasker Apiyo, a consultant physician with vast experience in the management of the haemorrhagic fevers, who was in charge of case management at the Mubende Ebola treatment unit, explains that by taking away some of the equipment used by the patients, for destruction, the health teams were performing one of the many health guidelines on the management of the disease.

‚ÄúThe health teams took away the property to ensure that the possibility of the Ebola virus that could be hiding on such surfaces does not get chance to spread,‚Äù she explains.

Her possible contact with Ebola

Nyongoma, like several other Ebola survivors from Madudu Sub-county, traces her contact with Ebola to a clinic at Ngabano Village in Madudu Sub-county, St Florence Medical Centre, just days to the declaration of the Ebola outbreak on September 20, 2022.

While the mysterious deaths that occurred at the Ngabano-based clinic shortly before the declaration of the EVD outbreak by government of Uganda were classified as probable Ebola cases since the tests were not conducted, Nyangoma witnessed likely symptoms of the disease when her three-year-old baby was admitted at the clinic.

‚ÄúThe only bed that was not occupied when my child was admitted was not clean. It had bloody-like fluids left behind by a patient. I got some water and cleaned the bed because I wanted my baby to occupy a clean bed,‚Äù she says.

The baby was diagnosed with severe malaria but fortunately, he responded to the treatment and got discharged the next day. But just two days after leaving the facility, health teams from Mubende hospital listed her as an Ebola contact after tracing and listing all the patients that had received medical care at the Ngabano-based clinic as Ebola contacts. This was just a day after the Ministry of Health declared the Ebola outbreak in Mubende District.

By this point, Nyangoma had developed severe body joint pains, a high body temperature and cold. Because she had been listed as an Ebola contact person, she was escorted to Mubende Hospital on September 21, 2022. By September 23, the test results from the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed she had Ebola. She had earlier been booked at the Ebola treatment unit at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital waiting for the test result from her blood sample.

Her son tested negative

Surprisingly, her three-year-old son who she nursed at the Ngabano clinic did not contract the disease.

‚ÄúWhile in hospital and after recovery, I was able to trace the circumstances that made me contract the Ebola virus disease. It was at the Ngabano-based clinic that I possibly contracted the disease,‚Äù she says.

At the Ebola treatment ward, Nyangoma encountered several challenges and was forced to take on the role of a caregiver whenever she had some strength. The mood at the ward, she says, was dark and depressing.

‚ÄúThe patients were fighting for life on their own and many called out for their relatives who were not even there. Some needed help while others seemed to want to say goodbye to their dear ones in their last hours of life. I got terrified but later gained strength because of my Christian background. I had to pray and encourage my fellow patients at the ward because they did not have their respective caregivers,‚Äù she says.

While she struggled and almost lost consciousness during the first week of admission at the Ebola treatment unit, Nyangoma reveals that God gave her the strength to read her Bible and preach the Word of God to the other patients. She was weak but had the strength to preach the message of hope to them.

‚ÄúAt one time, I collapsed and fell to the ground after preaching. I was put on drip water because my body was dehydrated. But I whispered to a nurse that had come to check on the patients to help me get my Bible nearer. I wanted to read some verses. The Bible was my strength as I battled the Ebola virus disease,‚Äù she reveals.

Nyangoma survived and was discharged but like other survivors, she experienced health challenges. At the time she was admitted, she was pregnant. However, she was not so worried about the baby. She had hope that since she had survived the Ebola disease, her baby too would survive after the medics earlier assured her that the baby was normal.

But two weeks after being discharged she lost her five-month pregnancy. Nyangoma says she felt sad about the loss of her baby but says as a Christian, she is always quick to find hope in God for a better plan and future.

effects

She also struggled with back pain and at first linked it to the kind of pains that women experience while giving birth. However, because of the medicine she gets when she visits the Ebola Survivor Clinic that takes care of the Ebola recovery cases, the back pain has reduced in frequency and she can now go to the garden and lift heavy objects. She also temporarily had a memory loss challenge and itchy skin.

    <text>Elijah Wamala's individual score of 100 on a night that did not click for the other top guns propelled Jets to first place in Match 10 of the Pursuit Swim League held last Friday at British School of Kampala (BSK) Muyenga.

He clocked 29.96 seconds for a new personal best (PB) in the 50m freestyle to add to the 40 points collected by his junior teammates Jowella Kirabo (42.98) and Nailah Nakitto (42.50) in the 50m butterfly and 50m backstroke PB challenges respectively.

Wamala then led the charge to collect the maximum 50 scores from the 8*25m backstroke relay and 40 scores from each of the 8*25m freestyle and and fly relays.

His captain Sonia Mwere explained that the "relays were easier because it was just eight swimmers unlike when they are more or less."

Jets have struggled with some of the slowest young swimmers when the relays stretch to 12 participants while the relays that require four or six swimmers are usually defined by fine margins.

However, when quizzed on why it was a tough night for other teams, Talons captain Abigail Mwagale said "Jets had Elijah in good form."

Talons actually collected 20 scores more than Jets in the PB challenges but struggled in the relays.

Colts who had the same 150 scores from the relays as Jets, had performed abysmally in the PB challenge while almost nothing clicked for both Astros and Flames, who suffered two disqualifications in the backstroke and breaststroke relays.</text>

    <title>Kabaka Birthday Run marks 10 years with a bang</title>

    <text>Thousands run. Many briskly walked or jogged as soon the race started. While hundreds did not break any sweat and instead stood in awe.

The 10th edition of the Airtel-sponsored Kabaka Birthday Run was proclaimed as the biggest ever staged in Uganda, with more than 100,000 tickets sold as the loyalists braved an overnight Sunday morning shower to pace around Buganda‚Äôs capital, Mengo in Kampala.

The mass participation race, which offers no prizes and official timing, concluded on Sunday as Kabaka Ronald Muwenda II celebrated his 68th birthday.

Held at multiple venues across the headquarters of the 18 counties that make up Buganda Kingdom, the combined number would comfortably eclipse the 52,812 people who finished the 2018 New York Marathon, the current record for a marathon.

David Birungi, the Public Relations Manager at Airtel Uganda said the event is key to bringing key health messages to the people of Uganda.

‚ÄúThe Kabaka Birthday Run is a beacon of light. We hope this encourages people to go out and know their HIV/Aids status. We are also happy for the big turn up. We hope it's a great moment people can continue looking forward to," Birungi said.

Over the 10 years, the Run has grown in prominence though the door has been left wide open for elite runners.

The testing time was during the Covid-19 pandemic when races were run virtually alongside a skeletal number that was allowed to join the Kabaka in his Mengo Palace.

Putting ourselves to the test

Started in 2013, the Run has tackled health issues like fistula and sickle cell disease in the past. The Run is now focused on the fight against HIV/Aids following Kabaka's Appointment as Africa‚Äôs Goodwill Ambassador in the fight against the AIDS epidemic by UNAIDS.

The Kabaka, who looked strong, emphasised accountability among his subjects and taking necessary action in his brief remarks.

"We renew our commitment to supporting the wellbeing of those with HIV, as well as those at risk for infection. Everyone should get tested for HIV and know their status," the Kabaka said before flagging off the race.

The third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-3) has a target to end the epidemic of HIV/Aids by 2030. This will be achieved when the number of new HIV infections and 'Aids-related deaths' decline by 90 per cent between 2010 and 2030.

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) leads and inspires the world to achieve its shared vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.

I&M Bank steps in

I&M Bank joined thousands of runners Sunday morning for the Kabaka Birthday Run as it reinforced its commitment to supporting social causes and giving back to society.

The bank‚Äôs staff joined thousands of other runners to contribute to the cause, demonstrating I&M‚Äôs commitment to being part of the fabric of the communities it serves and making a positive impact in people‚Äôs lives.

I&M Bank Uganda launched its operations in Uganda in November 2021 following the acquisition of Orient Bank.

Speaking about the bank‚Äôs participation in the event, the Ag. Managing Director, Sam Ntulume said the Kabaka Birthday Run was an excellent opportunity for I&M to contribute to a worthy cause.</text>

    <title>KCCA cry foul despite victory in netball league</title>

    <text>KCCA netball club registered a 47-40 win against Police in the national netball league on Saturday at TLC court in Kamwokya but not without being disgruntled by the day's officiating by the umpires, which they deemed biased and unprofessional.

The game that started in a stalemate from the first quarter saw the sanitation side extend the lead to a two goals difference at the end of the first half to register 22-20 goals.

This was thanks to their industrious goal keeper Hanisha Muhameed who managed to intercept two balls from their opponents in the shooting circle.

KCCA coaches made various changes in the second half of the game hence improvements in the second half of the game.

Shadiah Nassanga was brought into the shooting circle to replace Mercy Batamuliza while Shalila Shafic came into the centre as Annet Najjuka was sent off.

Prudence Nakato was also brought into defense.

Police never made any changes till the last few minutes of the game.

Their team was already fatigued after their first fixture of the day which ended in a 57-47 goals win against Life Sport.

Police Captain Barbara Kwagala says her team members were tired and they also had some fear for their opponents KCCA hence the loss.

"My players lacked confidence while facing a better side, we are going to make sure they gain more confidence and also improve themselves. We expect better," she said.

Meanwhile KCCA coaches were all disgruntled after the game citing poor officiating by one of the umpires.

It should be noted that even their fixture against Makindye Weyonje a week back was stopped in the final quarter after fans questioned an umpire's decision through threats.

The league organization committee is yet to resolve this issue and it is still unknown whether the game will be replayed.

The continued abuse of office by umpires has become KCCA 's greatest fear as the table leaders strive for their first trophy in the league.

"The umpire's malice against KCCA is un called for. We know they are not used to KCCA maintaining an unbeaten run but they should be fair while officiating," said coach Douglas Katabalwa.

In other fixtures UPDF beat Posta 54-35 while Police downed Life Sport 57-47.

    <title>Saka penalty miss proves costly as Arsenal blow lead again in West Ham draw</title>

    <text>Arsenal blew a two-goal lead for the second game in a row as Bukayo Saka's penalty miss proved crucial in the Premier League leaders' damaging 2-2 draw against West Ham on Sunday.

Mikel Arteta's side struck twice in the first 10 minutes at the London Stadium thanks to goals from Gabriel Jesus and Martin Odegaard.

But just seven days after squandering a 2-0 advantage in their 2-2 draw at Liverpool, the Gunners again cracked under the pressure of the title race.

Said Benrahma's penalty reduced the deficit for West Ham before the interval and after Saka fired his spot-kick wide early in the second half, Jarrod Bowen volleyed in an equaliser for the struggling hosts.

It was a hammer blow for Arsenal, who sit four points clear of second-placed Manchester City but have ceded the title race momentum to Pep Guardiola's team.

City had closed within three points of the Gunners after beating Leicester 3-1 on Saturday and it is the champions who have the destiny of the title in their hands despite trailing Arsenal for much of the season.

City, who have won their last 10 matches in all competitions, have a game in hand on Arsenal.

With a home game against Arsenal looming on April 26, City know they will lift a fifth title in six seasons if they win their remaining eight matches.

By the time Arsenal travel to the Emirates Stadium they will be seven points clear of City if they beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton on Friday.

Yet that gap would still look uncomfortably small to Arsenal fans fearing their team are in the process of wasting a golden opportunity to win a first title since 2004.

While City are battle-tested in handling the tension of the title race, Arsenal's young squad look to be suffering an ill-timed attack of nerves.

Arsenal anxiety

It could have been so different for Arsenal after they needed just seven minutes to take the lead as Odegaard's deft pass found Ben White, who delivered a low cross that Jesus slotted home at the far post.

Jesus's fourth goal in his last three games was followed by the Gunners' second three minutes later as they ruthlessly punished West Ham's woeful marking.

Gabriel Martinelli's pin-point cross found Odegaard in acres of space and the midfielder blasted a volley past Lukasz Fabianski from an acute angle six yards out.

The turning point came in the 33rd minute when Arsenal, looking a little over-confident after such a swaggering start, needlessly conceded a penalty.

Thomas Partey surrendered possession to Declan Rice and when the West Ham midfielder picked out Lucas Paqueta's run, Gabriel Magalhaes' mistimed sliding tackle was correctly ruled a penalty despite Arsenal appeals for handball.

Mohamed Salah had missed a penalty against Arsenal last weekend, but they were out of luck this time as Benrahma sent Aaron Ramsdale the wrong way from the spot.

Michail Antonio's header was tipped over by Ramsdale moments later as Arsenal started to creak.

Saka should have eased Arsenal's mounting anxiety when Antonio conceded a 50th minute penalty with an outstretched arm that blocked Martinelli's flick.

But instead Saka spiked the tension level even higher with a woeful spot-kick that completely missed hit the target, a costly blunder that recalled the England forward's Euro 2020 final penalty shoot-out failure against Italy.

Saka held his head in his hands and with Arsenal clearly rattled, David Moyes' side snatched an equaliser in the 54th minute.

Thilo Kehrer guided the ball into the Arsenal area and Bowen was just onside as his volley ricocheted off the turf and skidded past Ramsdale's despairing dive.</text>
